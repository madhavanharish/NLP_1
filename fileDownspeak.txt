In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.Thank you for considering this request. Tai Woo,Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spotvolatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period.You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.

Organization Announcement (Correction)I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below.It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.Henry  Van I can't get attachments - please send teXt copy John,I met with Ben regarding the Precedent Agreement this evening.  He had thefollowing questions/comments:1 "Shipper's power plant construction by August 1, 2001, then eitherParty may terminate this Precedent Agreement by providing the other Partywritten notice of such termination.  ; provided that such right to terminatemust be exercised on or before August 3, 2001.  In any event, unless theShipper provides written notice to Transco on or before August 3, 2001 thatit will enter into a Service Agreement , the Precedent Agreement willterminate automatically.2. Can we make the Guaranty effective after August 3, 2001 if we do notterminate the Precedent Agreement?3. In talking to Gerald Nemec, it also occurred to me that we need todetermine any balance sheet effects of the Guaranty in relationship to thisproject.  I will check on this tomorrow and let you know.Thanks.RDG Thanks Chris.  According to Patti, Williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up.  When, the site becomes available lets plan on rerunning the capture to get the last cycles for the missed days.Mat Below is an updated list of recent contract terminations.  I believe we need to review our internal notification system to make sure this information gets distributed in a more timely fashion.United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).Ameren EnergyGPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).Call David Portz at 3-9239 with questions. I have not seen a termination notice. Attached is a DPC press release that we would like to issue in India on Saturday morning their time.  Due to coverage of related issues, this timing is important.  We have been advised that these facts need to be disseminated to be responsive to the judge's remarks and before the Mumbai High Court  hearing scheduled for next week.The DPC press release is significantly more detailed than normal Enron practice, but is deliberately styled to be appropriate for an Indian audience.  In fact, we anticipate that a number of Indian publications will run the release verbatim.  Of course, this will likely result in international coverage, as well.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Please let me know if you need additional information.John Please, take a look at this resume.  Shirley,Is this an upgrade for Maureen?Vince  I agree with the concept as it adds a degree of clarity.  We are however moving towards a fixed fee approach with the service providers in the organisation as I found I was spending too much time validating the 'controllables' which I think under your scenario would be monitoring the RCs.  So essentially, we (EA) will be paying a fixed transaction fee to the Energy Operations and IT functions which will be embodied in a contract, I will know my costs and nothing can just be allocated to me.The method of arriving at a number will be using historical numbers versus a growth projection for the number of transactions, I believe this will work for new businesses too.This method allows me to concentrate on Enron Americas whilst not incurring large allocated charges which I spend time investigating.Buyer of Service		Enron North America LLCSeller of Service		Enron Net Works LLCService				All support services for the operation of its daily business activities.Price per transaction		0 - 5000 transactions/day 		x cents per transaction5000 - 10000 transactions/day		x cents per transaction>10000 transactions/day		x cents per transactionBonus premiums	/ penalties	Premiums and Penalties associated with specific performance criteria to be agreed (Eg Noms made in a timely fashion for 100 					consecutive days).Louise Please Mark your calendarThe ENA Gas and Power Technical and Commercial Support Performance Review Meeting will be tentatively held on June 21, 2001.  Details to follow. Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:Producer/Wellhead GroupThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.Strategic Asset  DevelopmentLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic  arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.Central Origination and Mid-MarketFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond continues to respectively run the West Gas and the Texas Gas Origination Groups.Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.Louise & John Here is the storyNovember productionwe purchased $31 MM of gas and sold $39 MM  On December 31, MGI paid us the gross amount According to Jaime, we have no formal netting agreement nor have we ever netted in the past  MGI assumed that once they paid the 39 we would pay the 31  We did not  Post-petition payment but pre-petition contract  We do not have a master, and I assume we confirmed using GTCs; Jaime did indicate that the volumes were comprised of several deals  He wants to know if he is going to get paid  I did not want to comment and told him that I would pass to you and gave him your name  Does he have a pre-petition or administrative claim?  He spoke to someone in settlements and told me that person (did not have name) indicated they could not pay him because of the bankruptcy Jamie's number is belowThanks,Tanya Rick, Ginger:This is the email forwarded to Elizabeth on October 2nd, 2001. The outside services for Risk Analytics are indeed minimal.Please let me know if you have any question.BrgrdsAI FYI- Anita,Can you call Maureen and ask if she plans to come to the office? Fax the attached word document to Jeff ASAP, thanks.  Thank you for the update. Conflicted - sorry EPA and TVA have been negotiating for some time over possible settlements inenforcement actions filed by EPA over modifications made to TVA power plantsin violation of New Source Review (NSR) rules.  Those negotiations to reachan out-of-court solution have officially broken down, with TVA filing apetition in federal court late yesterday opposing EPA's NSR enforcementallegations.While many felt TVA might settle with EPA (since it was governmentnegotiating with government), TVA has taken a very strong stance, indicatingthat they made some offers to EPA but that EPA's unreasonable stance wouldcause severe harm to grid reliability, the financial viability of TVA andpocketbooks of the ratepayers.   Southern Company and Duke Energy filedpetitions supporting TVA.EPA is insisting that these court filings will in no way stop the Agency frompursuing NSR enforcement measures.I will keep you posted as to any developments in negotiations or courtactions in this area.Jeff KeelerDirector, Environmental Strategies(202) 466-9157 The Weather desk will be offering a Power Financial Product.

If the hourly desk has taken a position, aControl Area ticket need to be created.If you have any questions, please give me a call X3-4873 or steno 635Thanks,Laurel Mr Skilling,I would like the opportunity to talk to you at some point to discuss your vision and goals for the BroadbandOperating System (BOS), and strategic development in general in Enron/EBS.Since EBS is currently focused almost exclusively on short-term tactical delivery  (which it should be), I'm notsure how strategic efforts like the BOS fits into those goals.   Balancing these tactical vs. strategic goals isbecoming _very_ difficult.  Indeed, because of the current customer-specific tactical deliverables, there isvery little strategic development going on in general in EBS.  Yet I know that BOS is still a very importantdeliverable.I want to make sure we're doing everything we need to do to support your goals and vision for EBS.It would _really_ help me if I could hear a little bit more about your short/med/long term goals for the BOS,and perhaps some of your thoughts about EBS' technology and products in general.  Then we could discussways to properly balance the tactical and strategic efforts to achieve those goals.On a different topic, I understand that you are currently thinking about potential projects for the Xcelerator.And I understand that you are focusing on technical products and capabilities that do not overlap the current& past initiatives at other business units.  I think that there are many great opportunities in that approach.I have seen a number of very interesting product concepts from various people in Enron thatwould fit that model perfectly.  And I'm sure there are many many more.   As a sample, I've attacheda short document  listing just a few of the technology-focused ideas that I have heard about.I also included the idea of commercializing BOS as a stand-alone product on that list.  Perhaps this isone way that BOS could continue developing within Enron without interfering with the current tactical focus.Obviously, EBS would still be the primary customer for BOS no matter how it is developed.just a thoughtThank you for your time.-larry Attached is an updated transitions list.Please review and send any changes so I can update.I will update again Thursday and will include a column for status.We are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a formal protocol for AEP.These are:Request for New/maintenance of counterparties.  Once Web page is developed, procedures willbe completed.Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.Request for new employee security.Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover theWeb pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to continuethe service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading whenAEP wants to continue trading.We have had discussions with AEP about all of these issues and procedures.

This report + the traction we're beginning to achieve in the market here supports the budget numbers you discussed with Joe earlier today.To reflect the Sato initiative which we're running independently of the Origination focus,  separate pages reflecting this have been added.Happy to take questions.Regards - Jeremy Jeff - here is the board resolution to make a cash distribution to enovate's members.  We are going to try to get this done today if possible.Thanks - Gregg The Federal Appeals Court ruling in the litigation over the EPA's Section 126NOx Rule was just released.  From a quick scan it looks like the  courtmostly upheld the EPA positions, and the Rule will go forward as planned(impelmentation May 2003).However, there are a few things remanded to the EPA for review and it'spossible this along with the delay associated with these remands could causea delay in implementation.  I'm also picking up from EPA sources that theremay be an effort underway to examine EPA's legal options for synchronizingthe 126 and NOx SIP implementation dates to summer 2004.I am reviewing the ruling in more detail and will have more detailed analysisto you shortly.JeffPS  Here's a link to the full ruling if any of you aspiring lawyers want totake a look yourselfhttp://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200105/99-1200a.txt Tom,Here is an answer for you vis a vis load growth.Hope it helps,Doug  Lisa - attached are three documents.Could you please print out and get Rick's approval and then transmit toSkillings office.

I have been continually impressed with his accomplishments and more importantly, at his extensive knowledge of Enron's business and priorities.I would like to submit my name for consideration as a replacement for the position of CTO at Enron Networks.  I realize the importance of the role that I fulfill with Enron Broadband and understand how difficult it would be at this time for me to leave EBS; however I could not allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my interest.  I am sure that a suitable solution could be formulated if it was determined that I would be the right fit for the CTO role.I appreciate your consideration, and will make myself available if you would like to discuss my qualifications.Respectively,Everett Shirley,We interviewed by phone Karthik and would now like to bring him for a visitto Enron.

Hope tosee you again this Friday.Zimin,Alex. Karen,Let me know if you need any additional information to set up my EOL ID.  Thanks.Mat NYMEX officially closed for tomorrow.  No ACCESS trading tonight.  No reopen until situation "safe" according to spokesman.CNN reports explosions in Kabul, Afghanistan.  CBS quotes unnamed govt source saying attacks likely attributed to Afghan opposition.  Osama Bin Laden based in Afghanistanviewed as most likely perpetrator. US Admiral Jeremy Quigley denies US involvement.RJ   You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publically listed company using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank.Then, you execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general officer, so you get all four cows back, with a tax-exemption for the fifth cow, of course.The rights to the estimated future value of the milk cash flow stream of the six cows are monetized and transferred via an intermediary to the Caymen Islands, secretly owned by a majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company, off-balance sheet, of course.The annual report says the company owns eight cows and recognizes milk revenue for the 20 year life of the cows.This is hedged with derivative cow life insurance policy through a Caymen Island bank, and these hedges are arranged through EnronOnline's commodity storefront with an option to buy one more cow, no balance sheet providedThe company says it will file all footnotes at a later date. Dave has asked that a Staff Meeting be scheduled for Wednesday February 7,2001, from 3:00 pm til 5:00 pm in 30C1.  Please mark your calendar and planto attend.If you have any questions and/or conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay3-0643). Thanks,Kay Shirley,Please, send Johan (address below) the info how to get to the building.  Mark and Jeff,The Paper & Pulp desk has a customer that they would like to put into a threeyear financial deal; however, the credit profile of the customer wouldrequire hefty upfront security.  At the same time, they would like to enterinto a contract wherein ENA purchases all of their production (newsprint) atindex prices.  ENA's payable to this company could run to 10MM/ month.  Canwe draft a netting arrangement that would allow us to net the physical andfinancial exposures in the event of a default so that the customer would notbe required to post security for the financial deal?  I think we may havedone something along these lines for a couple of Fred Lagrasta's customers.I am comfortable that the purchase payable will more than offset thepotential financial exposure, but want to ensure that you are comfortablethat the ability to net these two exposures can be assured through acontract.  Let me know your thoughts. Shirley,Looks good. Please, let the Research team, except for me, Krishna, Stinson,that it is not mandatory.VinceShirley Crenshaw03/17/2000 11:41 AM FYI  I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interestby Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicatingthat the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that weshould be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we willneed to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think ifour number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, butI think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say,2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe.The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.Thanks. Please review asap as dynegy would like to put in place for the next settlement.  We currently settle gross with them.  On Duke, does the document address the power stuff? I thought Carol said it only addressed gas (regardless of their intent). Please give me call.  My asst will track me down or cell is 713-857-3887Thanks Angela, if in your view, the issues brought up by Chase are an underlying dissatisfaction with the "entire" agreement, particularily the commodity "savings and advice" component, perhaps it would be advantageous for both Enron and Chase to sit down and re-negotiate.  From our point of view, given the execution and contract issues we currently have with the contract, this may be a win-win for the companies.  Let's sit down and discuss strategy - if you think it would be advantageous, I will replace Tom as senior level contact.As per my voice mail from this weekend, I would like to get ahead of the potential issues brewing at a number of the other accounts particularily Starwood.RegardsDelainey  approved Shirley,Please set up an informal interview:VKVSSGKPZLTTVince  Attached is the prioritization list of the system enhancements from this morning's meeting.  As we discussed, the estimated timetable to implement these changes will be before the end of the year.  If there are delays in any of these items, whereby a December 30 deadline can't be met,  please let me know ASAP.  We intend to communicate to customers early next year as to our progress on these items and other customer service enhancements.In addition, I have attached the first set of FAQ's that will be distributed to customers and posted on the website. Let's get the doc done before we go final.  The doc has to state that the deal is firm and that amounts due ENA are free and clear of all claims.

Good Morning!Bottom line: No Changes.For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teensBy Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week Then, early in the11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

Shirley,Please, send this memo to the entire group and ask if this demo was givento anybody in our group.  To all Energy Operations employees:ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especiallyproud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication thatyou have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize youfor that.Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENAand Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to makesure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, andthat any barriers that may impede your work are removed.To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization  S.J. BashenCorporation  to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will;to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where wecould improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools"and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultantswho assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC willmeet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlightour successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments,and the like.

I know it has been a while, but I wanted to send you the follow-up on our conversation last week, to make sure I heard everything correctly.Please let me know if the notes don't correctly reflect your memory of the conversations.Thanks a bunch!ab. yes While there are certainly pros and cons both ways, I agree with Jim to leadwith the market structure issues.  This was the focus of FERC's order and weperhaps overemphasize the refund issue by elevating it to number 1.  Plus, welose a little credibility since, like the UDCs, we would come across as, atbottom, primiarily concerned only with maximizing our financial position, andless concerned with trying to be a constructive force in shaping acompetitive market in California.  That is not FERC's priority.  Finally, andI say this will great equivocation, I believe that FERC carefully drafted therefund language, that it knew exactly what it was doing, and is unlikely tomove off that formulation either way.  The issue is still of utmostimportance but for the foregoing reasons as well as those stated by Jim, Iwould prioritize it just below the $150 soft cap and prospective refundissue.  Ron<James.D.Steffes@enron.com> 11/22/00 10:30AM >>>As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focuson making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible forbusiness over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think thatthe key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing theburden/risk of the prospective refund period.I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power /retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do muchmore on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can giventhe current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become anissue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight thisfight.I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bringthese issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of ourother arguments.Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position byquietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, canyou please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  Iwant to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not gettingtoo soft.Jim NOTE 1) New SAP Company Number from 0364 to 7001NOTE 2) SAP will notify Sundar when they are ready to accept data, no SAP customer or Vendor numbers are available at this time.NOTE 3) All "Primary Flags" are Yes in all instancesI have completed the setup of the test NETCO Counterparty and address roles as follows:CP ID #167117Name: NETCO External Gas/Power 1 (With Good Credit)ERMS Short Name:NETCOEXTGASGroups:FinancialPower-HoustonPerson Contact: Test NETCOPerson Corresp: NETCO CorrespondencePerson Notice: NETCO NoticeFax Number: 713-646-8876 (fax on 25th floor)Operation Effective Date: 12/01/2001Master Financial Executed: Set to YesBank Information: One Wire will be shared by all payments, partner bank will be 0011Address roles:Product Category	Deal Nature	Contact Type		Mkt.

In accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business Units.This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of granting each one of you access to this report.  When access is granted to all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business unit.Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns.Thank youShona Wilson (X39123)DirectorGlobal Risk Operations What day does it show I was paid for the flights to the UK?I can't find the payment in my acco9unt.Oh OhLouise KitchenChief Operating OfficerEnron AmericasTel:  713 853 3488Fax: 713 646 2308 THE COUNTDOWN IS ON!The Associate & Analyst Website you have been waiting for is almost ready.It is called AXIS and the official launch date is Monday, January 31, 2000.This AXIS site has everything you need in a user-friendly format.

Rick Shirley,Please, forward tot he group.  I'm guessing no.  Government bills aren't numbered as indicated below.  The current Senate bill 602 is the "Common Sense Federal Election Reform Act of 2001"; current House bill 602 is "Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act."  No email stuff in either one, I would assume.  The only email related bill is HR2281 "The Digital Divide Elimination Act of 2001."  This relates to tax credits to help lower-income people buy computers.  I can't find a record of any "Representative Tony Schnell."  I would also note that the Washington magazine is a monthly, not a weekly as suggested below.Also, most "PLEASE FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!" emails are hoaxes.  This was a fun test- got any more?!RJ Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations thatreceives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to findout about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abusedHouston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as fosterparents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going tothe center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchinand meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who weretemporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad tohave made that pledge.Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receivematching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profitorganizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch yourcharitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one timeeach year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make adifference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by anemployee is matched by Enron.If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doingso as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion nextWednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making apledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enronemployees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.

A change will alsobe made to Global Contracts and UNIFY, and is intended to assist with OAvarianceson STORAGE.On the next release (mid August) we will add a drop down on the STORAGE dealtype which will be a required field.Someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will bea required field - physical facility or synthetic.(We can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to beconverted - as well as results for Global conversion)Global Contracts uses the flags from SITARA to set up new contracts - soSITARA will add the flag on the deal.The flag will be stored in Global Contracts - which will feed the flag toUNIFY.Once the existing deals are converted in SITARA, Global Contracts can add theappropriate flag to their system.Once this is complete and UNIFY is ready, UNIFY can begin to feed in theinformation from Global Contracts, and we will thenbe able to differentiate the two in the accounting system.In the interim time, you may want to identify your synthetic vs. physicalstorage deals.Let me know if you have any questions.

The letter directs AES to make payment directly to our consultant ($100k) with the balance to us by check ($2,010k).Please let Kay, Staurt and I know if you're OK with this (via return e-mail), and we will send it to AES. Stuart, Kay and I have each reviewed the letter.I expect that we should be in a position to receive these funds hopefully late next week.Thanks,Ben Chonawee,This was perfectly all right. As a matter of fact I expect and encouragethe members of the group to disagree with me (or anybody else)on any subject. I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestationof ability to think independently and having the courage of one' sconvictions.Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The onlyway we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and thecompany) is by having open communication.  In Enron,facts are friendly.By the way, it was an excellent presentation.VinceChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON01/04/2001 03:10 PM Team:Please see the attached format for the TX Business plan to be submitted to Louise on 7 January.

They prefer a bilateral agreement because they feel that if they unilaterally extend the termination they may erode their position relevant to a termination at a later date.  Jeff - without seeing the agreement, I am assuming that this works in form.  Let me know if this is correct.  I am expecting the agreement to be sent to Laura this evening.  If I receive a copy prior to that time, I will send it on for your review.Thanks - Gregg If you have any questions please give me a call.Regards,Brian Team,Another great meeting this month!

I appreciate Jeff giving me a few minutes out of his busy schedule (May 24 at 3:00 p.m.). Here are some questions that are pertinent for our discussion.Are there two or three experiences you look back on having been especially valuable in helping develop your leadership style? Why did you find them valuable?How have your views on leadership changed over time?How do you think organizational changes or global changes impact on leadership styles?What motivates you and how do you motivate others?Do you ever have time to reflect on your leadership style in a particular instance? if so, what process do you use for evaluation?What are the most important leadership skills for the energy industry? Does leadership style change for other industries, such as the airline industry or the automobile industry? Gerald turned it over to Shemin Proctor (ext5-3910) when he left.

Shirley,It's an IT request for Sandeep.Please, help.Vince  I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:11/13/01	4,069:7211/10/01	21,010:1511/10/01	3,319:40Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.

It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative. Hello everyone.  More fun issues from Chicago.  I would like to discuss thedifferent options available for giving parent guarantees to third parties.As everyone knows, to date we have had two third party transactions requiringparent guarantees.  In the Trunkline transaction, each parent issued separateguarantees for 1/2 of the requested amount, negotiated by respectivecounsel.  In the Alliance transaction, Enron issued a guarantee for theentire amount and Peoples has presented us with a reimbursement agreementwhich we are reviewing.  Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4, toapprove the risk management policy.  Assuming the policy is approved, dealflow should begin to increase and I would like to discuss how theseguarantees can best be handled going forward.  My thought was an hour or sonext Monday, Oct. 2, to the extent everyone is available, with a follow upmeeting with Peoples perhaps Wednesday.  Let me know how your calendar looksand I will coordinate the meeting.Jeff & Kay:  Although this has been initially focused on parent guarantees,this is part of a larger issue regarding negotiations of enovate contracts ingeneral.  For instance, we have agreed to templates for a Master Purchase andSale Agreement and a GISB Agreement.  However, who is authorized to makechanges and negotiate on behalf of enovate?  We can discuss any suggestionsfor handling these situations as well.Thanks, Agenda:1. The Role of the Fundamentals Group (Kevin Presto)2. Review of Fundamental Reports and Projects3.

In short, the agreements do not specifically address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take releases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he was going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. now), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load growth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considering the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heavily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done recallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the deliverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talking to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequent is VNG's asset manager.Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as well.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questions, please ask.Regards,Ed Shirley,FYI  GREAT JOB TO ALL!!   We made it from contract execution to financial close in 5 months.  This success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of you and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction, including:1.

Transitioning HPL's hardware and software infrastructure from Enron to AEP4.	Unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value of over $150MM5.	Separating HPL's business process, work flow, from Enron (after 75 years of integrated operation)6.	Segregating property between leased and purchased facilities7.	Collecting and sorting over 14,000 boxes of books and records8.	Moving over 250 people from 4 different Enron entities into a new location while keeping the pipeline operating.7.	Accounting for the transfer of PRM assets, CWIP, leased assets, purchased assets, imbalances, payables and receivables.The transaction freed up approximately $725MM of capital that Enron can put to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses, but the work on HPL is not over yet.  There are a number of follow up activities that we need to complete in order to maximize the value of the HPL transaction.  Jim Coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis, including:1.	Collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with AEP to resolve imbalances.2.	Closing out accounting entries for property, work orders, external accounts payable, and internal charges.3.	Eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilities.4.	Fully transitioning HPL systems, facilities, and books/records to AEP.Again, thank you for your effort - and if I have inadvertently missed anyone please pass along my appreciation to them as well.  We will be hosting a lunch for the Enron/HPL employees who worked on the transaction on the 15th of June at 12:00 in the Imperial Ballroom at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Please attend if your schedule permits.Regards,Brian Shirley,Fine with me.Vince  Did you get this? All, Please see attached Thanksgiving Holiday Coverage schedule for my team and have a Great Turkey Day!Team:  If I have missed anyone, please forward.Thanks!  Elaine Shirley,Please, ask me about it.Vince Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled inthis mandated training program.  It is ENA's goal to have all its officersthrough the program before the end of calendar year 2000.  The course hasreceived very high marks for effectiveness.  Please take time now to enrollin the program. Speak to your HR representative if you need help gettingsigned up.RegardsDelainey Sequent has provided notice to terminate the Asset deal on Oct 31, 2002.  The deal would have automatically extended to Oct 31, 2003 had notice not been provided.FYIFrank Steve wanted you to know that he will be attending the Gov. Davis meetingtomorrow with Greg Whalley.Just in case you need it, here is Steve's bio. Please get this printed - it is not formatted at the moment Shirley,Can we send flowers?  My understanding is that we have posted bonds in excess of $60M and are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy.EPMI and EES are not relying upon an Enron Corp. guaranty to provide any part of the financial assurance required by NEPOOL.Suggest we can take one of four courses of action:  (1)   Do nothing;(2)    Request and authorize the ISO-NE to disclose to concerned NEPOOL participants the fact that EPMI and EES 						           have posted bonds to ensure compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy and that no part of the    						           financial assurance required is provided by an Enron Corp. guaranty;(3)    Send a letter to all NEPOOL participants confirming that EPMI and EES financial assurance obligations are being 						           met solely by the posting of bonds;(4)    Combination of both (2) and (3).If there is a perception or a clear understanding that the credit downgrade of Enron Corp. is the reason for a reduction in trading activity with EPMI and/or EES in NEPOOL and that NEPOOL participants will respond favorably if they knew that the financial assurance is provided by way of bonds, not an Enron Corp. guaranty, then option (1) should be discarded.Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to "concerned" participants.Option (3) and (4) will ensure that any letter we send out will make its way into the press, almost as soon as it is sent and if we send any such letter out we need to be prepared to meet any media interest. Further, the publication of any such letter in the press may encourage other counterparties in other forum to demand that EPMI and/or EES post bonds in order to continue trading and could materially adversely affect our trading activities.If we considered that any disclosure would make a material difference to the confidence that NEPOOL participants have in trading with EPMI and/or EES, my recommendation would be to pursue Option (2).Marcus Vacation, Friday, November 9. Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and ForsterHelloI am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency.I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.Thanks Anita,An updated agenda. We still need Grant's bullet points.Vince I just spoke to Terry regarding the September dispute.  He is willing to spilt the difference if we can come up with an appropriate letter agreement .  He would like us to draft a letter stating that both parties are agreeing to a negotiated volume/dollar amount.  The language should state that both parties are not setting a precedence and are not waiving any existing rights.  The volume/dollar amount is not based on anything specific.  Please do not send dispute notice response.  I believe that we will have a deal.He is also mentioned that we should see their response to the test protocol tomorrow.They received the CO2 response and it was what he expected.  They are currently claiming Force Majuere on their Praxair contract, but have not been sued yet. They were pleased with the fact that we are posting a quality reminder and are feeling better about their chances of a commercial solution with CIG.They are also planning to send us some kind of communication (demand letter) on EPPI.Sorry for the abbreviated note.  If you have questions, call me.

FYI  Texaco has short paid us by 1.5 million for Socal cuts.  I believe that they claimed a penalty on the net out for the amount.  We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.Mike Grigsby No money has been paid into my account in expenses ever - where is the money going.

Let's change all D's to T's.  Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.  Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.Mat Shirley,I shall come.

Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations.I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is:C673EVTo begin the survey, click on the link below: http://63.211.208.100/GLOBENetwork/survey.aspYou may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.Thank you. I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, could you please advise me of the right Enron person.That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this deal make sure that liability to Enron under the fuel  management deal be fully understood.  We are doing what we can to minimize penalties or costs, but we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me know your thoughts.Regards,Ed In celebration of EnronOnline's one millionth transaction this week, we would like to invite you to a celebration party on 	Thursday, June 7th from 5- 8 p.m. at The Grasshopper (506 Main Street @ Prairie in downtown).

Are the other 215 'master' typecontracts?  I would agree that the Appalachian deals probably won't getassigned - these are John Singer's I believe.  I am really only concernedabout those contracts where we are selling gas.  To the extent that you canhelp Bryce Baxter determine which of those unasssigned deals are sales so hecan quantify the delivery risk, I would greatly appreciate it.

I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update.Thanks.Irma AlvarezHR Svc ConnectionExt. 3-1543 Please be certain that I am copied on all negotiations with any master netting agreement of any kind.

Alice LeBlanc of the Chicago Climate Exchange is still in town, as she lives in NYC and cannot get home, and will be coming by at 2:00 pm today to talk about the exchange if folks feel up to it and are free.  I will plant to talk with her regardless and hope that some of you can join us.  But we will try to re-schedule for early October if today does not work.DETAILS:TODAY - 9/122:00 pm3AC 15 CIThanks. Over the past few weeks, we've put together some rules for each group as to whether or not they will be officializing, how frequently etc.  However, since the data I'm sending you today is the 12/31 data, many of these rules don't apply.  For the 12/31 data, we want to ensure we have correct VAR & counterparty data for SEC reporting, so for those of you that are not officializing due to lack of staff, we still need you to calc and officialize your data for the 31st.Over the next day or so, based on the below, I will be following up with each of you to determine if there is any VAR or counterparty risk that was not captured and then asking you to officialize the 12/31 books so we can pick up the complete information for the 31st.  I will then put together a deadline to get it done so I can rerun VAR.Thanks for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or comments, please call me at X39123.Thanks,Shona I just sent this link to Mark as well. It's a hoax  This e-mail made it into a reporter's hands and the reporterasked about this in the Clinton-Lazio debates in NY.  CNN covered the hoaxthe next day.The US Postal Service denied it, of course. By the way, I have never seen aletter  "P"  following a bill number in the Congressional numberingsystem.Sherri Sera11/07/2000 01:33 PM Shirley,Please, identify the time slots when everybody is available at the same time.We can do the interviews together.Vince  Note: Brian Petty forwarded this to me on 11/17/00 and I thought it would beof interest.Joe Hillings Just to follow up on our conversation about the PMA, here is a summary of my comments:1. The add to 3.6 is good.  In addition, with regard to MGU's obligation in "(a)" therein, please address or stipulate the actions that MGU is required to take with regard to maintaining assets sufficient to meet their merchant load requirements through contract extensions, contract replacements &/or new contracts during the term.  I know that our sales obligation is limited by the aggregate limit of the contracts assigned to us, but I do not think that we want to rely solely on that to incent MGU to maintain a full compliment of assets.2.  In Section 5.3(d), the term "support" might need to be fully addressed with MGU.  Not that we need to change the language, but it sounds like we could eliminate a potential misunderstanding if we gain a clear understanding now about the scope of their expectations and make sure that from day 1 of the agreement that the parties are clear as to what is expected of each other.  Thereafter, we will need to take whatever steps necessary internally, including systems, people, processes, etc, to be able to fulfill that commitment.  ENA has good systems for producing reports in for running our business.  As we have found in the VNG deal, where we really have no reporting requirements, generating reports and data in response to VSCC regulatory requests has been VERY manual and time consuming.  To that end, you will likely need to consider adding staff to respond to the requests.The other changes to the PMA and the GPA in total look fine.  If you have any questions, please ask.Keep swinging,Ed Shirley,No problem.VinceShirley Crenshaw05/16/2000 09:14 AM FYIMy trip to Wharton (yes, again).  Chris,Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.BackgroundThe west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.TaskSynthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).TimelineThis is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.Mat <Embedded Microsoft Excel Worksheet> Anita,My version.

Thanks!Ed The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filedan Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commissionfor Disclosure of Information.NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies ofISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, theywould ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties tothe proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answersubject to an appropriate protective order. Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUCrequest for public information.DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidentialinformation is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR ServicesCo. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOLmarkets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then itshould be subject to a protective order which contains the following:The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.Only specifically named "reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may reviewthe information.The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from NortheastUtilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expeditedcommission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request fordisclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes theselective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatorycommissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy requestexpedited action due the financial implications and there is alsoconsiderable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market inJanuary, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pendingCommission guidance.

Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.Thanks for your help.Mat The following people are joining the  Research group reporting to meeffective immediately.

I will be back in the office on Monday  if you hear anythingtoday or on Friday, please let me know.RDG Answer of PJM Interconnection, LLC., to Motion of New England Public PowerSystems for Deferral of decision until January 15, 2001.  At issue is whethera ruling by the FERC on the merits of PJM as an RTO may set an unfairprecident that may affect other regional RTO filings.  In their answer PJMasks that the FERC not delay action as requested by NEPPS and argues that thefact that a decision may be precedential clearly is not a basis forwithholding a decision.  PJM adds that Commission guidance as a precedentwould in fact, be beneficial to RTO development.  PJM is also concerned thata delay would affect the creation of PJM West with Allegheny Power since adeferal until January 15, 2001 may affect the negotiations and implementation. Please review/comment on the attached presentationGary - can you and JD take ownership of this.  Once we incorporate everyone's comments, we can set up a meeting with Air Products, Dow, and others to discuss.Thanks,Brian Dear Jeff,I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region andidentifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines forOFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a fewproblems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron forcuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one monthdeal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on aninterruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Canyou help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transactbusiness with our customers in the west?I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the westdesk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's gettogether and discuss exactly what I may need.Sincerely,Mike Grigsbyx37031 Jeff,Following on from our brief discussion during your last visit to London, Ijust wanted to give you a heads-up on where we are with the Du Pont/ETOLsteam/power deal given the discussions you and Harold had with them earlierin the year.  Based on prior experience in getting to closure with Du Pont,there is a chance that someone senior from Du Pont will put in a call to youor maybe Lou/Tom to express disappointment on progress and encourage Enronconcessions, resulting in premature deal closure for us.ETOL has tabled a blend-and-extend deal to Du Pont, in which they have showninterest to get to closure.  However, they just want to transact on the majorvalue items for themselves now and then deal with other Enron value itemsnext year in good faith.  We have indicated that we will commit Enronresource to get the whole deal done as soon as possible, specifying a Jan 01start, and will not allow cherry picking.Whilst the overall impact to ETOL is PV neutral, the deal does substantiallyreduce long term volume risk on what is already a deep in the money deal forus.  The motivation for DuPont is that the deal results in immediate annualsavings, around $3m in 2001, which fits with their corporate goal to deliverenergy savings.If you are called by Du Pont and need more info let me know.  We want thewhole package from them.Matthew Shirley,Please register me and remind me abou it.Vince  Martin,What about 8:00 a.m. tomorrow (Wed) morning. Makes sense. The customers were engaging in risk reducing trades to lowertheir exposure.I am curious about the most recent volumes.Vince I will not be in the office today (on my schedule) due to doctor appointments for my children.  I will be available on Thursday to discuss.  I have been coordinating with Gregg Penman, Richard Tomaski, Hunter Shively, Jeff Hodge, Lou Stoler, etc. and will set a meeting for Thursday to discuss how to proceed regarding PEC.  My assistant will coordinate the meeting.  I do not want this contract/s discussed in a large group due to the confidential nature and the protection of the ongoing Chicago business.  Don, I need someone to provide Irena with the name of a bankruptcy attorney who can attend.I appreciate your understanding on this matter.

I don't seem to have heard of it but LAvo said it was on WEdnesday or Thursday The list below that Cyndie prepared contains approximately 300 contracts thathave not been assigned. Can we verify that these are all contracts that areactive?  Also, who in our organization is continuing to pursue theseassignments?  Columbia would like to reduce the guaranty (I have agreed to areduction due to Risk's analysis that no MTM exposure exists, only deliverywhich I have asked Bryce Baxter to quantify); however, further reductions aredependent on Bryce being able to determine the receivable risk assosciatedwith the unassigned, active contracts.  The attached expense report is approved for payment.Jeff Skilling  Can you please add Phil's assistant, Amelia Alder, to the cc list for any distributions to Stan's Direct Reports.Thanks,  Elaine Below is a summary of upcoming RTO-related events that Enron is participating in.************************************************************************************************Week of October 22Regulatory proceeding before the Indiana Commission on the transfer of control of transmission assets by the IN IOUs to MISO and Alliance.Wednesday, October 24FERC Meeting - Discussion of RTO Developments for the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest.

Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB)The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.  In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.GISB REPRESENTATONStan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTINGThe development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATATwo separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.Thanks,Theresa Samuel,I need the following people set up as a trader on all book in the SVCE Portfolio.

This will require all Counterparties' not having a Master Agreement governing Physicals to accept the revised GTC in order to continue transacting in these Physicals.In order to ensure minimal disruption to trading we are taking the following steps.There will be a pop-up announcement to this effect on EnronOnline on Monday Oct 29thThere will be a ticker with the same information all week , next week on EnronOnline.The modified version of the GTC will be available on EnronOnline all week, next week for any customers wishing to have their legal departments review it before they accept it.The EnronOnline marketing group will be contacting customers who had previously accepted the GTC to make sure they are comfortable with the changes.If you need more information or have any questions please call me at X 31787Savita Shirley,Please, register me for Friday.  Please move (when you get in tomorrow)Move Geof and Steve til WednesdayMove Hotte until end of weekMove Calger to ThursdayThanksLouise lets talk  Tana,Can we accomplish that by you initiating a change to their current tradingprofile in Profile Manager ??Regards,tm Attached, please find a tool to help each of you deliver feedback to your employees during the  MY Review process.  We jazzed it up for you. Make sure your volume is on low. The ENA Estate Group meeting will be held today at 1:00 pm in ECS 05990.I look forward to seeing you at the meeting. Mike,I had a short conversation with Michael Brown regarding this organizational announcement.  As you can see, Eric Shaw is now responsible among other areas LNG terminal development in Europe.  Michael explained that this expansion of EEL's efforts was at the initiative of John Sheriff.  He recommended that you and John have a conversation in order to agree on our groups responsibilities and efforts.  As per our 2002 plan we have already begun the review of Europe to determine the economic feasibility of a terminal with the objective of making a determination in Q1 2002.I agree with Michael in that it would be my preference for you and John to iron this out as opposed to having conflicts at the working levels among our groups.  Obviously, we need the EEL gas desk to make a sharp market for current and future LNG deliveries.My pitch to John would be that we would like to have a similar relationship with EEL as we do with ENA.  (i.e. they make a market for pipeline gas and we develop terminals, we take terminal positions, we build and manage the global Enron merchant portfolio, etc.)  Two obvious benefits to our current structure are a coherent global LNG strategy and one risk book to manage the associated business risks.Regards,Eric Shirley,Please schedule an interview with Konstantin on May 8.Stinson, Zimin, Alex, Tanya, Krishna, myself.Vince  Shirley,Let's act on it.Vince  Thanks Jim S.I suggest that we notify AEP of this amount during our meeting with them this week.  We also need to develop a process of how we are going to update them of the impending volumes at the end of May without compromising our trading position.Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June bid week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging.Brian Jeff,Mike Brown is going to help us get used turrets for London.Thank you.

However, given the filing deadline (Wednesday) further changes are likely to be wordsmithing unless someone vehemently objects to the structure.regardsMike ext. 57634PS  There were no objections to my thoughts on structure so we have concentrated on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (ie A spot market is Enrons solution)  We then state that if others have different views, any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions  Finally we attach a simple interim solution as an appendix (so it does not detract from our main argument structure) so that if there is an ongoing debate we will be able to take part Shirley,Please, add Gary Hickerson to the list.Vince  Shirley,Please, forward my bio to Crystal.  thanks.

These letter centers are located in Three Allen Center, on the ground level, behind the down escalator, near the U.S. Postal Services self-service area and in the Enron Building, at the back of the escalators near the automated teller machine.Letter-sized envelopes, as well as boxes up to 18"x 13" x 3" can be shipped via Next-Day Air, Second-Day Air, Third-Day Select, UPS International and UPS World-Wide Express Service.In order to eliminate service disruptions, please apply a completed label to the envelope or box, in accordance with previously communicated shipping instructions.  When utilizing the shipping documentation available at the letter center, please include the Enron account number and your company code and cost center in the reference fields.Pick up times at the letter centers are 7:45 p.m. for Three Allen Center and 8:00 p.m. for the Enron Building, Monday through Friday.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Glenn Lewis, Global Strategic Sourcing contract manager at 713-646-7512. Shirley:Don't panic, but we have a new employee,  Chonawee Supatgiat, who is startingon Feb. 8th (yes, today).    Sorry about the short notice, but he justaccepted on the 7th at 5 P.M.     He will be primarily supporting EBS (EnronBroadband Services) and reporting to Ravi, but we will need to find a spotfor him on the 19th floor.   He can even use my office temporarily if neededsince I have a desk on 44 as well.I'll talk to you about the specifics in the morning.thanks, Gentlemen,I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3power trading desks.I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found itvery useful for modeling transmission problems.Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of thisrecommendation.Vince  Martin,It's OK for Walter to use remaining hours. No real cost to Enron,just the benefits.Vince I think wholesale will be well covered.Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. We assigned the agreement to Onondaga Energy Venture some time ago, so I would presume that matters pertaining to ENA no longer apply. Any thoughts on this? Also, if ENA still applies, I would presume ENA's bankruptcy filing would protect against any such termination. Anita,Please, catch me tomorrow to talk about it.VinceAnita DuPont@ENRON04/25/2001 02:48 PM We are planning to hold a meeting to kick off the Phase 2 project ofEnronOnline on 3rd March in Houston.  This meeting will focus on the new lookfor the site and content to be added based on our own thoughts and thefeedback from customers and our own trading desks.A more strategic meeting on the direction for EnronOnline will be held later.An agenda will be sent out at the beginning of next week.  For those outsideof Houston, copies of all presentations will be sent to you and you canparticipate by phone if you wish. She  will come on Thu at 10:15.  I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track. I just wanted to pass you a note on these guys, since we had you call Bob Nardelli a couple of months ago to see what we could get going. Home Depot issued and RFQ and we responded with a non-conforming bid. We have, however, been chosen to exclusively negotiate with them (beat out Reliant and TXU) for their energy spend west of the Mississippi. We are focusing on a spend of about $50mm a year. We are also looking to help them with some of their problems in California, They entered into a number of 1-2 year deals with third party providers that were brokered for them by SRI and as they expire, they don't want to go back to the utilities.Just wanted to let you know that we are making progress, and at the right time I may ask you to make another call to Nardelli. New Subjects;- I also have hooked up with Liz Flynn at Chase. She is an executive vice president and reports directly to Shapiro. She will look to me as the senior Enron contact for our deal and is aware and supportive of the corrective actions we are taking as well as the need for some restructuring.- As you know, we have recently closed 3 deals with Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties. We did 5 year deals for their Chicago, NY and Boston based properties. We are in the midst of looking at other regions as well as negotiating a term sheet for an off-balance sheet partnership that would perform DSM and look at Distributed Generation opportunities at their properties. I think it would be great to have you call Sam and say how great it is that we were able to begin doing business together. I will send sheri a note with his number and some deal details if that is acceptible to you.Thanks,Jeremy Shirley,No problem.VinceShirley Crenshaw09/29/2000 02:13 PM Shirley,Thanks.Shirley Crenshaw02/28/2000 08:31 AM Kevin, Here is the revised list from Shelley's team.

Shirley,Please, set up a meeting with me, Nelson and Vasant.  YI  The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to LouiseThese plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith KillenFirst year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinateWe need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.(iv)	Due DiligenceWe continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.Happy New YearLouise Shirley,Do you have a logo we can use? Plz, fwd it to her.  Elsa/Ken, what's the status on the deliverables for weather, heating oil, and propane? Following is what I recall from our last meeting:Weather:1.) Physically locate 2 individuals on EES product floor that will focus solely on weather products to our retail customer base, they should be sitting here now.2.) Have at least one weather product fully developed/structured and ready to roll-out to the sales folks in the targeted customer channel. The timeline on this was        Monday, September 10th. Be sure you have a weather contract fully developed and sign-off from retail legal (Vicki Sharp).Heating Oil/Propane:1.) Have one person identified to manage both products together. Physically locate them on same floor with EES product development. Timeframe on this was this week.I'd like to set up a meeting with both of you, Jeremy, Vicki and myself to review the product and marketing approach before we roll it out to the sales force.

The results in the attached word document show that Dabholenergy costs are several cents below that of roughly 600 MW of distributedgeneration which has been identified in Maharastra.  This 600 MW does notinclude innumerable small generators which will have even worse energycosts.  The excel spreadsheet contains the data and calculations.Regards,Stinson  Davis Besse would like to delay their  inspection till Spring outage but it appears that the NRC has a lot of issues and are concerned about there analysis of the situation.  It is more than 80% likely that the NRC will request them to do an inspection in late November or early December.  This information will be confirmed during the beginning of November There is a potential that counterparties will allow us to promote a small group of individuals simultaneous to deal closure.  To facilitate that process, please provide a list of those individuals you would like to promote along with a brief explanation to your HR generalist no later than 12:00 pm on Thursday, January 10, 2002.Please keep in mind that the nominee should have been in his or her current role for at least a year and received a 3 or better rating during the mid-year PRC process.Listed below are your HR contacts.Gas Trading and Gas Origination					Jeanie SlonePower Trading and Origination/EOL				Amy FitzPatrickTax/Accounting/Legal/Credit/Treasury/IT Infrastructure		Sarah ZarkowskyIT Development							Mandy CurlessGRA/Weather							Anne LabbeSettlements/Risk/Volume Management/Document/Energy Ops	Tana CashionYour HR representative will be contacting you in the next day to review your employee lists as well as discuss any promotions.

Or in New York? The Research Weather Group has posted the 2001 Summer Outlook on ResearchIntranet Page, under the Afternoon Video Report.The links are:http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com/Gas/sections/weather/InHouse/MorningComents/discussionContent.asp?item=Afternoonand  http://enaresearch.corp.enron.com/research/framework/default.asp As everyone is aware, Peoples provided notification to Enron MW, L.L.C. of its desire for credit support or termination effective December 28th of the Master Physical Agreement between EMW and PGL.  Richard and I met with Raulie, Dave and Tim this morning to discuss the implications of the termination and our ability to continue to fulfill our obligations regarding the deals that are subject to the Master.  After much discussion, they (PGL) have agreed to delay any termination until either the end of January or February (they are going to discuss internally which makes more sense).  Therefore, unless a higher power overturns our agreement, PGL intends to issue a letter amending their previous notification/assurance letter.  If anyone has any questions or comments, please let Richard or me know at your earliest convenience. Thanks for the note.  I certainly know by responses that I am getting tonightwho is in the office late!  I was told that the memo would come out today -you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!  I am really pleased abouthow we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does andits importance to the organization.  And yes, we need more female names onthese lists!

Pat, you may be interested in this from a gross/net perspective.  On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any commentsplease respond to him by May 25, 2001.Dave DelaineyFollowing my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached.The actions points from this excercise are:1	to review and agree the attached mapping2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease ofreference. Shirley,Please, forward to the Research Group and confirm I shall come.  Rick,This is disturbing.  I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enronbusiness unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on thegrounds that the records being sought are confidential.  As you know Sanjayreports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as Ibelieve McDonald for Global Assets.  Given this split accountability, and thefact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as arepresentative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access tothese records as part of your audit responsibilities.  If you think itappropriate for me to make the request I will be happy to do so.Kevin  Have thought of a way around this. - Find out as much as you can on why it happened and lets discuss. Just a reminder.  I apologize to those of you who are getting this twice - I want to make sure that everyone gets it. The attached memo provides an update on the HPL HR transition issues we discussed last week.  Fran has also added some support to her HR team.Regards,Brian Randy Lord with building maintenance advised us that HL&P had a switch problem that caused the Enron building to lose all commercial power. The UPS systems switched to the auxillary generators and there was minimal impact to the computer rooms and Gas Control Center during the outage. The backup chiller on the roof did not kick in automatically and building maintenance performed the switch manually. The computer rooms warmed up a bit, but not enough to be a problem. They plan to bring contractors in tomorrow morning to determine what the problem was with the backup chiller. The Gas Logistics business systems did lose one server but there was minimal to no business impact. Gas Control was not impacted.We will check with Randy tomorrow morning to see if HL&P has determined the root cause of their equipment failure. Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.Gary Kenagy and Scott Abshire Tammie,Sally is on vacation this week, therefore she will not be attending staffmeeting.

US Financial MarketsEmergency Site RelocationThe emergency site relocation for firms affected by the WTC bombing is going well on the fixed income and commodities trading side. Trading is being relocated largely to New Jersey and Connecticut. There was very significant contingency planning here, and it is being put to good use. The futures and equities markets are not moving as quickly due to telecommunications problems. Bond trading, which will resume in Tokyo tonight (as reported in the press), means that the cash market in the US should start to come back tomorrow.ForexThe foreign exchange markets have been quiet, as the Fed reportedly stepped in and told people to settle their outstanding issues, but not to initiate new directional positions or large arbitrages.InsuranceThe insurance firms most affected by the crisis are ING Reinsurance and Allianz. These firms may have capital issues from insuring losses related to the crisis - they were overconcentrated in this area.Transportation/Infrastructure IssuesTelecommunicationsCommunication issues continue to be the biggest problem. This is the only area where sufficient redundancy was lacking. For example, Citigroup is having problems with e-mail capacity and is cutting back on all non-essential e-mails. This continues to be the chief barrier to resuming operations.Crude/Products/RefineriesLOOP Terminal now restored to regular operations.Maritime TrafficAccording to Dow Jones, dry bulk shipowners were reluctant to lease out vessels on long-term contracts Wednesday, after terrorist attacks in the U.S. Tuesday brought security issues to the foreAir TrafficMidway Airlines announced today that effective immediately it has suspended all future flight operations.

John, I plan to speak with Sequent by the end of this week to inform them if we are interested in returning the assets to them and if so under what structure.  I have checked with Cris Sherman and others in Accounting, they have determined that the "East Desk" does not have to accelerate the payment of its "debt" to John Arnold's book if we get out of the Hopewell transaction. That being said, you were checking on the real $$$ exposure to retaining the Hopewell deal past the VNG transaction.  The way we are currently booked we are not interested in restructuring the VNG/Hopwell arrangement. If on the other hand we see real $$$ exposure, this is the perfect time to try to combine the VNG restructuring with the Hopwell exposure.  I need to understand our position this week if possible.Frank Shirley,It will take a lot of effort to compile this list.Please, remind me about it.Vince  fyi, please respond, tx rick  Shirley,FYI.  It looks like Cantekin will be starting on May 22 (summer intern).Can we find him space on 19?  Sandeep,Please, ask them if they can accept our invitationto lunch following the meeting?Vince http://www.stanford.edu/group/sia/ Martin,No problem. Please, ask Stinson as well.Vince Anita,OK.  Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly otherstate and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Callregulation in court  and lost  will file an appeal with the U.S. SupremeCourt this September.As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit,upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on theregulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing andsubmitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000.States that must now develop SIPs include:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware,District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, WestVirginia, Wisconsin  (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from theregulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventuallybe re-included in the SIP process)Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal:Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay ofthe EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finallydecided.    It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by theCourt.  An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginningof October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIPanyway.   States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay willbe granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadlineand EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP)  if the stay isnot granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements forNOx reductions in its state.Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule and compliance by emitting sources  may also be delayed if the SupremeCourt imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal.   Ifthe case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001,which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004.We will keep you posted as this situation develops.  Right now, EnvironmentalStrategies is continuing to work in the states that are developing SIPs, toensure that the states treat new generation fairly and that market-basedsolutions to NOx reduction are employed so that trading and otheropportunities for Enron businesses will be maximized.Contacts:    Federal regulation, Court action  Jeff Keeler 2024669157State Implementation Plan development  Mary Schoen  7133457422 here's the latest draft.

Still working on the banks.Mark shirley,FYIVince  We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub+	Development		Jay Webb+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster+	HR			David Oxley+	Cash Management	Tom Myers+	Credit			Debbie BrackettThe rest will be completed shortly.We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.

"Brown, Charles" <cbrown@newportgen.com> on 10/24/2000 03:34:58 PM Chonawee,As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a baddecision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to$100.You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercisegives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxeson your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss againstordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your optionpositionas an offset.The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get thetax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you haveincome in thefuture (or capital gains).Not so good.By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock optionsis a very interesting and difficult problem.VinceChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON07/10/2000 11:40 AM You may just need warm bodies at this point, big boy Please find the attached status update for the HPL transaction.

I talked toPatti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a usersperspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as tohow the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go overdifferent scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  Wecan see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I didnot want to forget them.1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, howwill we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changesat a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but itwould affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm surethere are a lot of others.Thanks. Text:  Please plan to attend and reception and dinner for Analysts andAssociates who have made significant contributions to ENA.

I want to personally thank you for all of your work following last week's tragic events.  I have come to rely on, and even take for granted, your thoroughness and competence.  Last week was a sterling example of what I have come to expect from your team.As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.Again, my thanks. Forwarded at request of Joe Hillings:Please find attached the final CSI letter sent to President Clinton onthe WTO services negotiations.

Jeff:Attached find a term sheet that we are ready to send to Global Crossing.As you know my team has been negotiating a deal for the sale of our dark fiber assets for cash and an obligation on the part of EBS to buy future services at market from the counterparty.  I am far down the road with Qwest, lagging with Level 3 and Global Crossing.  The terms proposed here for Global Crossing would upgrade their previous bid from "not even close" to "very competitive" but would still not guarantee a deal.  Global Crossing has some tough challenges (credit) that some others don't.Call if you would like to discuss.Stewart713 345-8989 Paulo,Can you please, help him with this?Vince  We may be able to handle this specific issue outside the policy committee,but I think it would be a good idea to set the next one anyway.  I'm surewe'll have something we'll need to talk about. Is this going to be a shower?  If so, I would like to get my own gift for them, if that is okay.  Or would you prefer that everyone simply contribute to the gift basket?  What time on the 20th  I'd like to put that on my calendar.  Does Louise know if it is a boy or girl?  Thanks.

How's the share price? We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50%probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also haveprojects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, andLouisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%.The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines andflip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, andhave received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets ofHartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 ifwe do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside isapproximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premiumbeing offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as wehave a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines withany of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for7FAs, although not all permits have been received). Shirley,do you think we can get another room with better speaker phone?Or, may be we can get better speaker phone?Viacheslav Danilov04/19/2001 12:58 PM Please call Trent Claughton and find out how we get access to the site (guestids) and if we need to download any software, etc. to run the system.

The conferenceis tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, theconference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner(February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics coveredin the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk managementand the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agendafor the 2002 event is under development.Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program,a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participationwill benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of otherenergy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and theagenda for the future. Let's try and keep this quiet. Tom, I have emailed John with your suggestion.  I will let you know his response unless he communicates directly back to you.

Here is the list for Friday's positions.  To give you an update on what the daily calcs are used for, information from RisktRAC and CAS is being pulled on an ad hoc basis to fulfill requests from both external and internal personnel/companies.  As such, books with any positions should be calced as often as possible.Also for the 31st, my understanding after talking to several groups is that certain groups have only limited resources right now and will not be able to provide accurate calcs for the 31st before late this week or early next week.  Please keep me up to date on the status of your information.  Once all books have been calced, officialized, and exported (to Athena) for the 31st we will rerun VAR and produce a DPR.Open questions:Cindy - lets discuss what should be done for ECTRIC on an ongoing basis as well as for the 31st.Kori - do any of the books listed with you as the BA have positions - if not we can inactivate themJeff - there are a couple of gas books that seem to have positions, NG-PR-OPT-PRC (which is inactive) and NG-PRICE-GDL.  Who can I get the status from for these?ThanksShonaX39123PS:  When you review the information regarding CAS - no position means no 3rd party position.  Since not all groups have deleted their intercompany positions, there may be books listed below as "no position" which do have VAR/P&L risk. Shirley,Am I registered?

Trip to San Francisco. Leave March 19, evening about 5:30.Meeting with KMV on March 20th. I shall need the hotel in SF.I shall come back on Fri evening (leaving SF around 5:30 p.m.), or Saturdaymorning(leaving around 6:30 a.m.) depending on the price difference.I shall take the rest of the week off.Bill Bradford, Bryan Seyfried, Vasant are going as well.2. Going to NYC for March 13 conference. A reminder.Vince Please allow me to take a moment to express our my gratitude to Enron for assisting us (my wife, 2 daughters and me) in our desperate time of need.  Although many in Houston were affected by Tropical Storm Allison to a degree worse than we, still we were in dire need of help.  Enron, the outstanding company that it is, came through for us.My family and I have been displaced from our home, and the sum total of our worldly possessions now fit inside 1 half of a 2-car garage.  Enron has helped us begin to put our lives back together, and I can think of no more eloquent or appropriate way to express our gratitude than to simply say, "Thank you."The immense pride I feel being a part of the most innovative company in the world has increased 10 fold.My most sincere thanks, Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/IndependentAgencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislativelanguage stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines forSIP submission and compliance.   As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Callthe courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000,and recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans toMay 2004.   While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, thecourts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federalNOx regulation from May of 2003.Industry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislativelanguage increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will beharmonized.  If the language passes, it will have the force of law depending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled toharmonize the laws.  On the other hand, this also increases the visibility ofthe language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in theappropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers thebill.  The language was not in the House version of the bill, and theAdministration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senatenegotiators in the end.This would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if thislanguage becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sourceswould not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004.  Rightnow, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126petitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things.We will keep you posted as developments occur. Shirley,Please, set up a phone interview. Stinson, Krishna, Paulo, Grant.  Shirley,Please, register me. Is there any  conflict?Vince  Sorry make that a pedicure My only suggestion are as follows:(1)  We need to be more explicit about the de-coupling of the assets from thegas that is delivered to CES by ENA.  As such, I would recommend that weexpand Sections 4.1 and 4.2  to include a CES paper pool storage or bankwhich gets credits (theoretical injections) and debits (theoreticalwithdrawals).  The credits to the bank would be made in accordance with the"Theoretical Storage Injection Schedule (TSIS)" as per 4.2 and Exhibit 2.The debits to the bank would be made per the daily CES nominations on dayswhen the retail demand is greater than the daily purchase quantity defined onExhibit 1.  The one exception to this de-coupling is that all of thedebits/credits would be subject to operational constraints imposed by the GasStorage Contracts and the Gas Transportation Contracts.  The constraintsshould only come into play with the debits, as the TSIS (which by definitionwill be less than the daily MDIQ) would rarely be impacted by constraints.At the end of the term, the bank balance and the physical storage balancewill need to be equal.  If not, provision needs to be made for a post termtrue-up.(2)  In the last sentence of Section 4.1, should the remedy for CES's failureto notify in a timely manner be "penalties" or "ENA damages," which wouldinclude both penalties and trading losses &/or opportunity costs?  I am notcertain, but I understood it to be the latter.Jenny Helton01/24/2000 04:12 PM cool Sorry about last week. I will make sure you get one today and find out what happened last week. Yan,As discussed, it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 6:30 am.  After the the refresh, the following West reports should be generated:  #25 CIG_WIC (daily), #40 Rockies Production (daily), and #9 Socal (daily, historical, merge).  Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.  In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).

Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.I would like suggestions as to:1)  Where to go.2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.4)  And any other ideas you have.In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.RegardsJohn This is a good article, on balance. Interesting how utilities have charged the highest rates.

I am assuming that the scope of the survey is to look at information technology tools that would enhance our effectiveness. If so, there are some tools that we used in South America and I do not know if we have an equivalent here.a) Itinerary Lotus Notes data base. -  Very convenient. It lists every one with the contact information and the latest itinerary. It allows people on the road to make last minute changes.b) Project document data base.-  This is in the Lotus Notes data base environment. It is a convenient place to find all related documents associated with a given project. (i.e. development of a power plant , or   a regulatory filing). Access is granted to those that need access to the "project documents"c) Project task status.- My personal favorite.- It allows people cooperating on a project to communicate and keep track on related activities. Good tool for weekly to-do-list.  Access is given to those that are working on the project. Lotus Notes environment.  Example - NERC related tasks. Yes, Adam Umanoff needs it I believe.

The link is http://www.questarpipeline.com/html/qpc_capacity.html.  We will need to start scraping this balance, specifically the "Total Clay Basin Annual Working Gas" and "Total clay Basin Reservoir Inventory".  This does not impact the storage Inventory issue that we've previously discussed, since this balance is currently a manual entry point, and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points.  Please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data.  We will need to create DRN's for both of these points.  Clearly, in terms of priorities, working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority.

Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report findsLynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff WritersTuesday, July 10, 20012001 San Francisco ChronicleURL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/MN48875.DTLSacramento  Texasbased electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere.Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest.The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas.Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable pricegouging by the big energy producers  most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California."Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used.Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover from customers.The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings.Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex,a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com .2001 San Francisco Chronicle    Page A - 9 Anita,We have to push Steve's presentation  one week forward.Rick Jones will be completing his presentation.VinceAnita DuPont@ENRON02/27/2001 05:11 PM Following please find the Daily EnronOnline Executive Summary.EnronOnline Executive Summary for 12/04/00Transaction SummaryExternal Transactions Today	5,500Average Daily External Transactions (30 day Trailing Avg)	4,097Total Life to Date Transactions	493,715EnronOnline Daily % of Entity's Total Transactions for 12/04/00	Trans	PercentEnron North America	4,957	80%Enron Europe Limited	119	27%Global Products	224	34%Enron Metals	200	8%EnronOnline Percentage of Total Corporate Transactions(30 day Trailing Avg)	54%Gross Notional Value of EnronOnline Transactions	TotalToday	6,718,666,961MTD	11,437,759,254LTD	290,608,284,119Average Daily Notional Value (30 Day Trailing Avg)	3,095,165,757Notional Revenue from Physical Flows to Date	19,315,426,224Counterparties, Users, and Products OfferedCounterparties having transacted to date	593New Counterparties transacting for the first time today	2Number of Products Offered Today	1,138Total Number of External Users Logged on Today	3,225Average # of External Users logged on (30 day Trailing Avg)	2,890 Kay, Due to this week's NFL games being canceled, the free agent draft will be held next Thursday Shirley,Please, put it on my calendar.

I plan to take the week of Thanksgiving off (Nov 19, 20, 21), and also take the week of Christmas off (Dec 26, 27, 28) and also New Year's Eve off (Dec 31).

We are gearing up to releasethe above referenced Product.Matt - I need a Sigma Factor please; there will be one Product Type for eachof the 'flexible' scenario's (i) not less than three day, not less than 5day, not less than 10 day:Country: USACommodity: US Nat GasUoM:  MMBtuProduct Type: Physical Index (Flexible)We are close to a final draft f the Product Description that will hit thewebsite. The laymans description of the Product is as follows:Buyer and Seller exchange gas during the month of June 2000.Seller receives 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO PoolIndex.Buyer has the right to notify Seller of when Buyer wants to take deliveryduring the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: notless than 3-day delivery, not less than 5-day delivery, or not less than10-day delivery (depending on Product Type). The gas nominated for each suchday would be between Zero and not greater than the percentage of the total300,000 MMBtu based on the number of days of 'flexibility' (i.e.; Buyerchooses 5 days for nomination, Seller would deliver not more than 20% of the300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%). Buyer paysTCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.While the product Description on the website accounts for both the month-longdelivery to the Seller and the 'flexibility' of the Buyer, the product shouldbe entered into the downstream processes, settled and confirmed as twodifferent products. This is necessary in order to give us the protectionagainst non-performance that the GTC's and master contracts support.Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed. Dale Debbie -Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska accessuntil we hear from you tomorrow? Shirley,I would like to  invite him to an interview next week. We should use his homephonenumber and/or private E-mail address.Vince  As part of the Bush National Energy Plan, EPA was instructed to undertake a "90 Day Review" of New Source Review (NSR) regulations and report to the President on August 17, 2001 on "how NSR is affecting the energy industry."  One month later, it will make more specific recommendations as to possible changes that could be made to NSR.While EPA's review includes long-term options like complete legislative overhaul of the Clean Air Act, it is likely that it will consider many of the more short term options available to it under existing regulatory/administrative authority.In the process of developing its recommendations, EPA published a "Background Paper" and opened a docket soliciting public comment on a broad range of issues pertaining to NSR.  EPA has also held public hearings and numerous stakeholder meetings.  Enron participated in stakeholder meetings, and also submitted written comments  as part of several organizations (EPSA, Clean Power Group, INGAA) and individually.The attached Enron comments, submitted last Friday, July 27,  reflect input from numerous commercial sources.  NSR impacts a number of commercial interests, including:development, siting and finance of new power plants;origination activities with customers seeking to upgrade, expand or modify power facilities;trading/risk management for power, gas, coal, emissions allowances;finance/deployment of emissions control technologies;industrial markets such as forest products, steel, refining/chemicalspower generation and natural gas pipeline operationsWe will continue to have opportunities to provide input into the process through EPA and the Administration, and would welcome further comments or examples of impact on our businesses.  Please let me know if you have any questions, or would like additional background information.  I will keep you posted on the progress of this issue as developments occur. Thanks please see the attached message points.

Thank you, Corp!Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team Corp and their amazing Lego structure, which won an award for being the Most United, made us proud.  Congratulations to all of the team members: Ed Coats, David Gorte, Bob Hermann, Amy Kim, Mark Palmer, Greek Rice, Chip Schneider, Jim Steffes, Mike Terraso, Dennis Vegas.Now let's show all of Enron that Corp employees are as generous as we are bold, smart, ambitious and innovative.At Friday's lunch, we received a little challenge from Stan Horton, CEO of Enron Transportation Services. He's betting homemade cookies that by close of business on Monday, August 13 ETS will have a higher percentage of their overall goal than all of the other business units. I do not want to be up all night baking chocolate chip cookies for Stan, so I think we need to accept his challenge and blow ETS, EWS and EES out of the water!The good news is that to date, Corp has raised $506,743, which is about 65% of our total goal of $785,000.The bad news is that only 21% of Corp employees have participated in the campaign so far.If you are part of that 21% that has already given to the United Way, THANK YOU.

Casualties are likely to be in the thousands. Two US "critical infrastructures"transportation and financethe cornerstones of the US economy have been severely damaged.2. Discount all gossip.  Responsibility will be put on many groups and many groups will claim responsibility.  There are no facts at this time.3. Nonetheless, there are a limited number of terrorist groups that could coordinate an attack with this many targets and this level of sophisticaton.  Indeed, it is likely that a state sponsor of some kind would be required to provide financial and intelligence support for such an attack.4. It is virtually certain that these groups or countries are based in the Middle East.  It is almost equally certain that a massive US response against a Middle Eastern target is forthcoming. There will be enormous domestic political pressure on the Bush Administration for a vengeance attack. This will be at least partially offset by a reluctance to further inflame Arab radicalism in the Middle East and Persian Gulf.5. As mentioned above, in addition to the horrendous human cost, there are economic and market consequences:Oil- IPE and NYMEX are closed.  Oil futures will of course react strongly to the dramatic uptick in Middle Eastern uncertainty.Equities General flight to quality.  Investors are selling equities and putting funds into cash.  Many major brokerages and trading firms have been wiped out in the WTC collapse. It will take some timedays or weeksfor these firms to restore operations.Currencies- Swiss Franc and US dollar will benefit from flight to quality.Shipping major ports and border crossing closed, surrounding areas jammed with traffic.  Impact on all commoditiessteel, lumber, pulp/paper, crude/products shipments, LNG, etc.  Ships at sea will back up, affecting pipeline deliveries.  Freight impacted by road chaos in major US cities.Metals- gold/platinum benefit from flight to quality.We will update as soon as we get information.

As a result of this analysis, we are pleased to announce that we have chosen MCI WorldCom, as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.Under the new agreement, MCI WorldCom will provide long distance services, calling cards and data services to Enron locations worldwide. Although the initial implementation process will begin immediately, more detailed information on how existing telecommunication services will be transferred to MCI will be distributed within the next 30 days.With the execution of this agreement, Enron will receive savings of $18 million over the next two years.If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS Senior Contract Manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Keith Dziadek, Senior Director of Information Technology at 713-646-6236.

Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, forexample, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone. Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue;however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohaneout of the day to day fray on this issue.

The meeting starts at 11:30. Please, be ontime.Vince  I've attached a memo prepared by Carl Imparato that summarizes the discussionthat we recommend be included in a filing with FERC that lists the toppriorities for fixing the California market.  (Actually, there are 7 topicson the list.  Item 6 is a list of things that FERC should not do, and item 7will not be pursued.)Our thematic approach is to explain that the California model worked fairlywell until this summer when demand outstripped available resources, which, incombination with wrong-headed CPUC policies (such as disincentives againsthedging), AB 1890 mandates, and ISO implementation decisions, caused pricesto spike.  Thus, the solution is to fix these policies, not to eschew thede-centralized California approach in favor of a POOLCO model favored bycertain entities.We hope to have a good draft to circulate by mid-week next week.  Please letme know as soon as possible if you oppose including any of these issues inthe paper, or the priority ranking or thematic approach discussed above.Ron PLEASE USE THE POSITION MANAGER HOME BUTTON.When using the SITARA Position Manager,  and you drill down to view detailsor change the dates, the Position Manager keepsall your views running in the background.  This feature allows you to use theBACK and FORWARD buttons to keep your views running.On the downside, if you keep these views running but do not really intend togo BACK to look at them, the system and your PC are working harderto keep all the old views active and updated.The HOME button sends you back to your default view - the first view you hadup when you hit apply.  By clicking this button, yourPosition Manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in.This is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need.If you do not use the HOME key, and keep drilling in and changing the dates,the Position Manager is still keeping all the your views forthe day running in the backgound.What we have found is by the end of the day, a user that does not clear outthe old views can have well over 30 views open, which is like having30 Position Managers up on your PC.  When that user closes down, the positiongets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views.We will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as faras the SITARA machine is concerned; however, your PC may still beslow with excessive unneccessary views open.   We could make a change tolimit the number of active views you can have open, but at this timeI am not sure that is necessary; regardless, in the mean time, pleaseremember to use your HOME button. Other helpful hints -Did you know you can shrink you tool bar?  Tools options - uncheck show toolbar text labels - Did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top andzones and meters below? Tools Options - show drill down second panel - If you have an OMICRON POSITION porfolio - your MIN/MAX button shows youACTUAL - and MIN/MAX for your day swing deals.Same works for NOM FLEX portfolio.

I do not see a problem assigining the ENA deals to ECC as they are current month deals that will allow netting of the purchases and sales.  Should not affect the PMTM which has a threshold in the contract.  Would like to try to finish up quickly. Please advise if anything CRM can do to help.Thanks,Tanya Shirley,Please, send it to the entire group.Vince**********************************************************************************************This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group forcleaning the conference rooms after  meetings. For many  visitors to Enrona conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company.Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunchboxeson the table.  Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you thatyour mothersdon't work here. Jeff:Although the contract with Adventis has been terminated by D.Cox via telephone, Partha Ghosh continues to try to facilitate the AT&T - Enron relationship.I continue to believe that there is no reason that you can not have a direct relationship with Dave Dorman to pursue opportunities at a high level.  I have always encouraged a direct call from you to D.Dorman to find out if we can wean ourselves from Adventis.I understand that you have a call scheduled today with D.Dorman I would like to take the opportunity to get a gut check on the previous deal if you think it is appropriate. Talking Points:Previous Deals ProposedWe previously proposed a transaction to establish a JV which would pursue the wholesale intermediation market for long haul bandwidth (see attached draft).You seemed interested in our proposal but we have had difficulty in getting a follow up meeting to confirm your interest and get your thoughts on the proposal.In the meantime, through Adventis, we proposed a different structure where AT&T would buy Enron's longhaul network and in exchange Enron would take back a take or pay (see attached draft).  In our view, it's really the same deal but instead of AT&T receiving value through an equity interest in a JV, AT&T would receive value through the take of pay.  The deal really accomplishes the same thing for us.The Strategy Behind the Deals ProposedEBS is really an acquisition for Enron that came with the purchase of Portland General Electric.  The communications company of PGE was going down the road of all of the other fiber over builders in the marketplace in that it intended to build out its own network.We have repositioning that company over the last 12 - 18 months so that it fits better with the Enron business model of trading and intermediation.  Part of this process likely includes reducing of most of out long haul positions to better facilitate intermediating the long haul market as opposed to  build, own and operate in it. The deals proposed to AT&T would assist accomplish this repositioning of EBS.Future CommunicationsPreviously we have spent much of our time communicating to you through Adventis.  This has been a challenging process for us.  Is it possible to establish a direct high level relationship with AT&T especially at the President (D.Dorman) to CEO (J.Skilling) level. I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday the 21st. I will be out of town but available via pager and cell phone.Don't hesitate to call if I am needed.Pager	713-990-8458Cell	713-870-8214Thanks, Gary Slava,Mike's phone number:(713) 553 5883.Vince Yes it is, and we will try Rick.  However, I assumed this was part of Op-Co or an ENA asset in your world.  I think Rick is doing power terminated book recovery. Shirley,Can you copy and paste it and send it to the entire group?Vince  Yan,Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list ofitems that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's FlowSummary sheet:PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheetfor February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday forFebruary 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT'swebsite for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however,sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the TestSheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, thewebsite we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until aslate as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbersfrom a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbersearlier.TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pullthe IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  Itlooks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  Theydiffer by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than theother.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or ascrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the websitebefore they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type thesenumbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers wouldnot be in when this report is run.El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plantreceipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas becauseI don't think this is a cycle problem.General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cyclefor the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can causeintraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to dayfluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  Isuggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current dayand the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well aspick up any intraday fluxuations.As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to gettingthis report ready to use.Mat Just a couple of suggested changes to both.There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?ThanksLouise Shirley,Yes, I think I am free. Please, set it up.Vince  Shirley,Please, give them the details that are included in a standard   bio plusE-mail,phone number etc.Cindy Derecskey@ENRON07/18/2000 12:06 PM Jeff,LondonI would like to have turrets for my guys in London.  As a small group where everyone is learning and involved in everything it helps for them to communicate better internally and externally.  I have been told by London that our phone usage does not warrant turrets.  I don't want that to be the basis on which the decision is made.  Paul and I believe they are necessary to the business, our cost structure is reasonable and will improve over time.I want the phones and I want to be able to operate the business as we see fit.  If London has a bloated cost structure that is their issue and I don't want them to make it mine.USA AllocationsI met with IT on Monday regarding my allocations and I still find them to be unacceptable.  For example, my overhead allocation is approximately half of Dan's, yet we have about 25% of the people working on our system.  I will discuss with Brent, but wanted you to know.

The proposed timeline at the bottom of the page shows that 'Imbalance Trading Ends' on the 16th calendar day of the month.GISB Standard 2.3.41 states that imbalance trading should be allowed through at least the 17th business day of the month.  The language of the standard is as follows:"Standard 2.3.41  Transportation Service Providers should provide the ability to post and trade imbalances until at least the close of the seventeenth business day of the month."This timing will need to be incorporated into the timeline.Thanks,Theresa Anita,Mu organizer seems to be tied up (not responding).Please, see if you have access to it.VinceAnita DuPont@ENRON04/06/2001 01:56 PM Jeff:Dave Komansky, Merrill Lynch's President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, would like the opportunity to meet you.

The note below from Kevin describes the communications issues we are having with the MOPS system. Apparently we are hopeful that comm will be re-established, on a temporary basis, this afternoon. We have also checked into the device types on the MOPS system to determine how much data can be stored locally. As you can see from the attached file, there are 7 of the 29 field units that will only store up to 7 days of hourly data. After that, we would begin losing data. To avoid losing data, if communication isn't available, we would have to collect locally using laptops.Gary. As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.   We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.

Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.The aim of the meeting is discussion  with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions,look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, andEnron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.DATE - TIME - LOCATIONTuesday, November 208:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.EB 8C1Video conference and teleconference capabilities are available.Please see the attached agenda.

He apparently overheard two guystalking in the bathroom about alligators and came to theconclusion that we are going to be attacked. So it must be true. Get ready to fax to me This is what I sent to Frank requesting the Master. It currently looks like we will not have any wire requests today for power prepayments.East Power - We are currently working with PJM and NEPOOL to come to a payment resolution to remain active and current in those two markets, and will not have any need for a wire transfers today (the earliest we will need may be tomorrow depending upon form of resolution).  Additionally, given the post Christmas market conditions and lack of liquidity (and staffing needs in companies other than Enron), Kevin and Dana were not able to execute any bilateral prepay deals for the regions outside PJM and NEPOOL.  They will be continuing to push these deals for the next several days, but realistically, it may be next week before we can actually pull these off.West Power -  We will have tomorrow a detailed prepay list and wire requests for the first week of January.Thanks for everyone's help with this process.Don Laura:Please work with Tom and the trading group to arrange an after work get together for the Texas team (admin and support included).

Given they are in the money, can we complete our legal review quickly.Thanks Tony Podesta(Georgetown Law)202/662-9772Karen Tramontano(Transition Office)202/501-3153 Terry McAuliffe(DNC)202/863-8121 Shirley,Please mark these dates on my calendar.  Shirley,Can you please set up the meeting.Vince  Jeff:Professor Howard Stevenson (Harvard Bus. Sch. - Entrepreneurship) will be in Houston on the 14th or 15th of June to discuss a new case study that HBS is preparing entitled "Modern Giants".  Professor Stevenson would like to feature Enron in the case and has requested a brief meeting with you followed up with lunch with any available HBS alumni.I have attached an email from the HBS Director of Development who contacted me, which summarizes the proposed case and provides a bio on Professor Stevenson.  Are you interested in Enron's participation in the Case Study? and would you be available for a brief meeting with Professor Stevenson - and possibly lunch?In my view, we need to refresh the Enron story being told through HBS Case Studies.  The Dabhol Power Case (still being used) is dated and does not reflect our business strategy.  I have asked HBS to contact your office directly to check your availability.Regards,Brian I've attached a current draft that reflects the comments from last night.  Asyou will see I've reorganized the draft along the lines suggested by JimSteffes.  Please let me know of any final comments ASAP.  Thanks.  Ron Shirley,Please, extend the invitation  to Greg and Liz.Shirley Crenshaw01/04/2000 12:18 PM I agree with Christi.RH Tom,Got your voicemail and e-mail.  Below is the explanation I received from Corp Benefits on the price for your recent activity through Hewitt.  Will get back with you on final resolution to this problem before the end of the week. Hopefully will have an answer for you by  Thursday, no later than Friday.Thanks again for your patience.Response:Irma,I've just verified the following information from Hewitt:On Tuesday, 11/20/01, Mr. Martin spoke with a rep at Hewitt to roll over his ESOP balance into the Savings Plan.  He made this request at 4:28 p.m.  Since this was after the market close (which was 3:00 p.m.), his transaction did not occur until the 11/21/01 update.  He rolled 1,522.00 shares over to the Savings Plan, at a total value of $7,625.22, which is $5.01 per share.  That value was posted to the Enron Corp. stock fund in the Savings Plan the evening of 11/21/01.  They were in his Savings Plan account as of the morning of 11/22/01 (which was Thanksgiving Day).On 11/23/01, Mr. Martin transferred his holdings in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund to the Stable Asset fund.  He did this transfer at 2:22 p.m., via the web site.  However, on 11/23/01, the stock exchange closed at 1:00 p.m., instead of the usual 3:00 p.m.  Consequently, the transfer was not effective on Friday, 11/23/01, but occurred on the next business day, which was 11/26/01.  At the time of the transfer, the value in the Stock Fund was $6,113.26, which was equal to $4.01 per share.Thanks again for your patience and cooperation.Irma AlvarezHRSvcConnectionExt. 3-1543"HRServiceConnection@enron.com" Can you center map on slide for me.

Access can be requested through use of the secutity resourcerequest form accessed from lotus notes.    Just submit the form requestingthat you be added as a user of the research group's Research ProjectsTracking database.thanks, Confidential - Attorney Client PrivlegePlease give me your thoughts on the attached proposal to resolve the "dangling chads" with AEP.  I have attached the proposal and a "value analysis" of the proposal, both of which I propose to send to AEP.  The key benefits of the proposal from Enron's perspective are the following:1.	Removes us from the vagueness and uncapped exposure of the Ducote deal with Entex for additional costs.  AEP can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to Entex associated with this capital expenditure.2.	Captures the leverage that AEP will have in the Entex audit.  I think for ENA to pursue Entex would be difficult/time consuming and may lead to a tortious interference suit from AEP.3.	Gives up the interest payment we think AEP owes us.  This is true value we are giving up, but do we really want to fight with AEP in court over this (to the extent they are not bluffing)?4.	Removes us from having to process imbalances - saving manpower costs and further removing us from hassles with AEP.  AEP is better able to capture value from these imbalances then we are, since they have the pipe.5.	Gets us out of the Coastline law suit.  I'm pretty sure Coastline is at least owed the $1.4MM that we would contribute.  AEP has a chance to minimize any further costs, which are capped by the value of the claim at a further $2.2MM.Please do not circulate this. Shirley,No problem.VinceShirley Crenshaw11/13/2000 10:21 AM Shirley,Yes.

Paulo,I have talked to Vince and Stinson about the Credit Model enhancement andextension.We will pull other reseource for the Potential Exposure model, so you will berelieved from this morechallenging part of the project.Due to our limited manpower, everyone is overloaded with multiple tasks.  Sowe still think youare the best person for the short term project which is adding the asianoption to the existing model (askAmitava for help if needed).I do not mind if you want to re-negotiate with the customer about thedelivery date, but keep in mind that EEShas done deals requiring the asian option valuation in the credit model.Zimin Group:I know you are all being forwarded the messages on the blood drive and the contribution matching by Enron (2 for 1) to charitable organizations in NY.  I know we ask a lot of our employees and sometimes all these "contributions" seem overwhelming.  I personally ask each of you to take time this week in your own personal way to give thanks.  We have group members who were close to harms way and the Central Region has family members potentially lost in this tragedy.The best way I know to encourage an official "time-out"  is to ensure you all start your weekends with your families starting at noon today.  Officially Central Origination/enovate are closed this afternoon.Sincerely, All,I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek.The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below.TransportationThe attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston.VideoYou each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).Please find attached the following information:(i) Attendees and Teams for Video(ii) Draft AgendaAny questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978)We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek.John & Louise Find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value ofcredit support for MG and PaperCo.My approach is as follows:1.   Assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps.2.   Spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors.3.   Calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap (thedefault option)  using Black's formula.4.   Treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows.  That istreat this value just like you would an annuity stream.  By discounting backthis stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk-reducedrate, I find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the twoNPV's.Please give your comments, especially if this makes no sense to you.Stinson Jeff,I spoke with Steve Semlitz this afternoon.  He basically wants to bi-laterally take our thresholds to zero on the ENA-Master with HETCO.  I informed Steve that I would run the concept by Bill Bradford.  Bill owns this issue and has spoken to Hess several times today (Grim Trevino/John Butala).Regards,tm Ruth,I have confirmed the meeting with Williams to discuss the Athens and Hart Co. projects for 3:00 on Wednesday.  Location TBA.  We will meet with Allen Smith and Orlando (Alvarez?).Regarding the Midway project in St. Lucie County (and other sites as well)  we need to get a rough estimate on the estimated schedule for completion.  In particular, we need to know whether it is possible to get gas to the Midway site by May 2002.  Is there any way we can talk to someone today about this?Thanks. Raimund D.

The press release indicates the RTO filing will be available on the web site prior to the teleconference.<Susan.J.Mara@enron.com> 06/01/01 02:22PM >>>From my sources:CA ISO is filing jointly with SCE and SDG&E.  The comments begin with atyrade that FERC has no right to condition price caps on joining an RTO.Apparently, they weakly support regional organizations and note agreementto work with the other RTOs that are now forming.PG&E is filing separate comments "because of its bankruptcy." PG&E willnote concern about the CA ISO "independence" and talks about other RTOs aspotentially good options.The CPUC ordered and berated PG&E to file its comments with the CPUC BEFOREsubmitting them to FERC.  PG&E initially protested, but was threatened withfines.  It finally filed yesterday under seal.Bottomline:I believe that the joint ISO/IOU filing is structured to provide theminimal needed to meet the FERC test. Therefore, FERC's price caps willremain in effect. Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't/ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category) With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt) If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-endOn a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite highand that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occourThanks.Enron Energy Services   I might be interested.

Hello Everyone.AEP has been very cooperative with us when we have posted numbers in error on EOL.  Please extend them back the favor if an issue comes up on their side.  Also please e-mail me if an issue comes up.ThanksJohn For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, & VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by the middle of next week.The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to position reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.

As you implied in your offer, it is important that we complete this transaction very quickly if we are going to do it.  My initial thoughts are that we would need to receive the payments over a maximum of 12 months not 24 months.  In addition, as we are using the assets to manage an unrelated delivery obligation I will need to either determine another way to manage that delivery without the VNG assets or transfer the short position to you.  I do believe that given the details of this delivery obligation you will see it as a positive value to you.I will provide an official response asap. I suggest that we consider a time on Wed or Thur of this week to get together for discussion.Frank Shirley,Please, put it on my schedule.  Shirley,Do you remember about Exceed?

I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.Thanks for your late and long hours.Louise Martin,Any thoughts on this project? As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc.Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.Thanks George:  a rather cynical view, don't you think? We are positioning ourselves to release a new Product Type that we will referto as a Flexible Physical Gas product. Legal is in the process of drafting aGTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. Iwill start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Typedescription; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how thetransaction works:Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool IndexParty B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to takedelivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of threeforms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominatedfor each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; IfParty B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B payTCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.I understand that this type of transaction is currently doneover-the-counter.

"I've watched analysts argue for weeksnowthat the exact vote count in Florida 'will never be known.' Well, I'm Godand IDO know exactly who voted for whom. Let's cut to the chase: Gore wonFloridabyexactly 20,219 votes."Shocking political analysts and pundits, God's unexpected verdictoverrulestheofficial Electoral College tally and awards Florida to Al Gore, giving hima289-246 victory. The Bush campaign is analyzing God's Word for possiblegroundsfor appeal."God's ruling is a classic over-reach," argued Bush campaign strategistJimBaker. "Clearly, a divine intervention in a U.S. Presidential Election isunprecedented, unjust, and goes against the constitution of the state ofFlorida.""Jim Baker's a jackass," God responded. "He's got some surprises ahead ofhim,let me tell you. HOT ones, if you know what I mean." God, who provided theexactvote counts for every Florida precinct, explained that bad ballotingmachineryand voter confusion were no grounds to give the White House to "a friggin'idiot." "Look, only 612 people in Palm Beach County voted for Buchanan.Getreal! The rest meant to vote for Gore. Don't believe me? I'll name them:Anderson, Pete; Anderson, Sam, Jr; Arthur, James; Barnhardt, Ron"Our Lord then went on to note that he was displeased with George W. Bush'sprideful ways and announced that he would officially smite him today. Inanactof wrath unlike any reported since the Book of Job, God has taken all ofBush'sgoats and livestock, stripped him of his wealth and possessions, sold hisfamilyinto slavery, forced the former presidential candidate into hard labor inasaltmine, and afflicted him with deep boils.Dick Cheney will reportedly receive leprosy.-30- I'll be out of the office the rest of the week. We are doing some enhancements to the Interim Offsite at the Hangar today. The Hangar Offsite willremain configured and available for use. I will be in Midland Thursday and Friday. I will be checking my phone mail and email. Don't hesitate to contact me via pager or cell if I'm needed.Gary It looks like there are quite a few gas books on this list.  Please let me know what the status of these are.Thanks TammieGet all the assistants to do it by the week-end Anita,Thanks.VinceAnita DuPont@ENRON07/11/2000 08:30 AM Jeff,It is my understanding that Credit is waiting on a Legal Review/Risk memo from you in regards to the MCV contract.  I am working with Stacy Dickson on other legal issues most of which have been resolved. I would like to establish this contract with MCV so that it is in place for future deals.Thanks for you cooperation, Attached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP.  The structure of the paper is summarised below:1.  RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry.2.  Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability.3.  A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap).  The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion.4.  During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP.  Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation.5.  If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP.6.  Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms.We would appreciate input on two issues.Firstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution).  While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP).Secondly, drafting comments on the paper generally.  Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution.A final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.regardsMike ext. 57634PS  i don't want to sway opinion but i thought it may be useful to state my view  I think that we concentrate on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (ie A spot market is Enrons solution)  Instead of proposing specific ICAP related solutions, we state that if others have different views, these should be debated in a specific FERC forum and any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions Shirley,Please register me for this.  STEVE KEANKatherine Brown09/26/2000 11:59 AM The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.  (As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)The Order states:"It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units ("EGUs") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year."   Translation:  This part of the order appears to "vacate" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.   For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.   Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.   EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens."It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the threeyear compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court."  Translation:  This more significant part of the order "tolls"  or puts on hold  compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.Impact:  The practical effect of this part of the order will be to delay implementation of the Section 126 Rule until May 2004, when the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation is scheduled to go into effect.   The EPA will not be able to reissue its Section 126 rules in a time frame that would require compliance before May 2004.  The NOx SIP Call would have supplanted the Section 126 Rule in May 2004 anyway  what this ruling does is take away some of the uncertainty that existed for the May to September 2003 period (original effective date of the Section 126).   This means that generators in states not covered already by existing NOx trading programs (OTR NOx program) will have another year to comply.I will forward any more detailed legal analysis as I receive it, but this is the latest news.Please call if you have any questions.Jeff KeelerDirector, Environmental StrategiesEnron Corp(203) 245-0828 office(203) 464-1541 cell Thanks for the note, Sherri.  I know that you read notes mail messages verypromptly!

Can you check with Racicot andFallon?  All of you continue to play a key role in the success of the sale of thePeakers, LVI & II and Pastoria.  A number of different parties are currentlyreviewing the book. Since we haven't had a chance to gather as a grouprecently, I thought it might be beneficial to send out an email highlightingthe schedule over the next several weeks and months.This week and next, we will be finalizing the due diligence room, the termsof the purchase and sale agreements (PSA), the management presentation and alot of other stuff.  First round bids due a week from this Friday, on Sept.29.    The week of Oct. 2,  we will be notifying those bidders that willadvance to Round 2 and we will be sending out the PSA.  The week of Oct. 9,the real fun will begin with management presentations, due diligence roomopening and site visits.  The key people involved in these activities shouldwork to keep their schedules as flexible as possible from Oct. 9 - Nov 3. Weneed to think about who can do plant tours, give presentations, etc giventhat the most logical people may be giving the management presentation,answering questions, and/or unavailable to lead the plant tour.  It is ourhope and expectations that we will have multiple bidders to juggle in thisprocess.  It is going to be a balancing act and I encourage everyone to beginto think through people and process.  The schedule then has us selecting ourpreferred purchaser(s) the week of Nov. 6, with a December 18, 2000 closing!I believe we have identified and dealt with many of the legal, accounting,tax and financing (unwind) issues surrounding the sale.

Market UpdatesU.S. MarketsUS equity markets are closed today but may open Friday. NYSE/NASDAQ/AMEX officials will reconvene later today to decide on restart.Chicago markets  (CBOT/CME) closed early at 1:00pm CDT, CBOT electronic a/c/e trading expected to resume tonight for grains, and resumption of all commodities under consideration.NYMEX: still closed, electronic Access trading planned to open later tonight (start time still under consideration)In equity news, frightened travelers are expected to avoid planes once carriers resume flying, prompting Standard & Poor's to consider cutting the long-term credit ratings of all U.S. airlines, British Airways and Air Canada. That would raise borrowing costs and worsen the industry's least profitable year in a decade. The losses at U.S. airlines, until this week predicted to reach $2.6 billion, may now rival the $4.8 billion loss of 1992.In Europe, the four biggest airlines  British Airways, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France SA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines NV  will all now post a fullyear loss due to their reliance on profits from the transAtlantic market.In Asia, services to and from the U.S. contribute 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue at Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines Ltd. Some $3.8 billion was wiped off the market value of airlines based in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and other Asian capitals in two days.  The plunge in stocks reduced the value of Asia's eight biggest carriers by about 14 percent.B.	Transportation/Infrastructure UpdatesAir Travel145 domestic airports have now been cleared to reopen, though Logan International Airport will remain closed indefinitely, despite the Federal Aviation Authority's decision to open U.S. airspace for commercial airplanes.At least some regularly scheduled United Airlines flights are expected to begin at 7 p.m. EDT Thursday, and some scheduled flights on American Airlines and TWA after 4 p.m. EDT.  Delta Air Lines said "very limited operations" would start sometime after noon EDT Thursday. Continental has canceled all regularly scheduled flights for the day, but planned to offer special service in cities such as San Francisco and Cleveland.Maritime TransportationOpen, including NY harbor, which is doing individual vessels inspections and escorts into the harborC.	Political UpdatesIndications are beginning to point to a substantial military strike against Bin Laden assets in Afghanistan as well as the Taleban government.Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's chief economic adviser:  "We've been working on getting the basic infrastructure of America up and running again, that's the main thing we've been doing."World Bank officials want to cancel their annual meeting in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, now slated for Sept. 28-29 in Washington, according to media reports.  The DC police have also asked that the meetings be cancelled, but World Bank officials must wait for Treasury Secretary O'Neill to make the decision. Bank officials fear the Bush administration will want the meeting to take place to underscore that Washington is back to business as usual.

RegardsDave and John Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:Producer/Wellhead GroupThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.

If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.

Paulo, Alex,Any interest?Vince  Shirley,Here it comes.VinceShirley Crenshaw01/04/2001 02:22 PM The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has extended the date for states and sourcesto comply with the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation to May 2004, from theoriginal May 2003 date.BackgroundBack in May 1999, a federal Court stayed the NOx SIP submittal deadline forStates, pending the final outcome of the NOx SIP litigation.   After the DCCircuit Court decided the case in March 2000, EPA asked the court to lift thestay on the NOx SIP submittal for States and give the states the same amountof time they would have had to submit their SIPs, had the stay not beenimposed in the first place.   Industry sources opposed lifting the stay, andalso asked the court to move the complaince deadline back a year, due to thedelays caused by the litigation.The Court lifted the stay on June 22, 2000, but was silent on the issue ofthe compliance deadline.  States are now required to develop their "StateImplementation Plans" (SIPs) by October 31, 2000.Yesterday, the Court decided that sources should have until May 2004 tocomply, giving sources an extra year to prepare for the new regulatory regime.Remaining QuestionsWith the previous 2003 compliance deadline, the NOx SIP Call regulations wereon the same time schedule as the Section 126 petitions, which were approvedby EPA (though a separate regulatory process  a nearlyidentical fallbackto the NOx SIP call) for many of the same sources and states as the NOx SIPCall.   The Section 126 Rule is going to be litigated starting this comingNovember, but the Court has not yet issued a stay of those regulation, norhas it delayed the compliance deadline to 2003.   Unless the Court places astay on the 126 Rule and delays the compliance deadline to 2004, sourcescould still be required to make substantial NOx reductions starting in May2003.   We expect the Courts to resolve this issue sometime before the 126litigation commences in early November.Enron ActivitiesSIPs are being developed by the states, with a deadline of October 31, soEnvironmental Strategies will be spending the next few months working toensure that the rules that are crafted in the states provide the mostfavorable treatment possible for our assets while providing a competitiveadvantage to our traders.   While the delay could benefit some Enron assetsthat need to comply with the regulations, it could also benefit ourcompetitors, who have another year to defer environmental compliancedecisions that would likely increase their costs and create otherdisadvantages for them.We will keep you posted with any developments as they occur.Jeff Keeler  (202) 466-9157Mary Schoen (713) 345-7422 Shirley,Please, can you coordinate this?  we are struggling through we have elp from a lady Loretta.

It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is abreach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30,2002.RegardsDelainey  We will need to add/assign this cost to NNG and TW Marketing cost centers under Dave Neubauer (probably Kim's??).  It needs to be included in the Gross O&M and in Project Specific Capital if it is not already (no effect on net O&M).  Then we will assign the amortization expense to the same cost center when we complete the functional earnings statements for Dan's Commercial Group. Jeff:I'm sure this is just a "misunderstanding", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one)  better for our company ???Andy I would be happy to, and yes you may use my name. Could you please forward my "P" number.  I am unable to get into the XMSsystem and need this ASAP.Thanks for your help. As we discussed, Enron North America Corp. (ENA) desires to re-establish its account with Paribas.  The purpose of this account would be to sell no more than 2,500 NYMEX natural gas futures contracts to hedge natural gas storage inventory for the months of February, March and April, 2002.  ENA is willing to post margin or otherwise to meet necessary credit requirements. Following this morning's meeting, we have agreed to have a fifteen minute conference call on a Thursday morning to give a quick update of issues.  Chris Calger will ensure a list of progress is circulated prior to the two calls.For those of you cc:d on this.

Up to this moment, the current criteriais still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last twoyears.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairscontinues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process,hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as "originators" creatingbottom-line value through (as an example):revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion)cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE):SimplicityConsistencyObjectivityReasonablenessEquityPerhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.With no specific preference, they are:A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmissionconnection (the percentage is subjectively determined)Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again,subjectively determined)The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had thelegislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached)The amount of financing needs that was secured for a dealNPV of a project.

Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:Mark Breese	EB-1457aEd McMichael	EB-1456cMelissa Solis	EB-1456dWe are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building. We are going to call Treasa in a bit to have her walk us through these PPAs.  Let me know if you would like to listen in. Y'all,Stinson forwarded a copy to me last week.  Part 1.1 was published in thispast Monday's edition as is.  I would suggest that unless you see some majorerror, don't suggest changes to Samer that would delay the publication ofPart 2, scheduled for this coming Monday.SamShirley Crenshaw@ECT06/07/2000 10:14 AM What do we need to know to make EBS a successful business?We need to identify 5 to 10 critical issues in order to help M.I.T. professorGabriel Bitran get his students focused on areas of interest to EBS.Your suggestions for interesting and useful research topics are due by nextWednesday morning, May 31.   Tom Gros will then forward the topics toprofessor Bitran.StinsonP.S.I really need your help on this. As a follow up to yesterdays Staff meeting I would like to implement thefollowing strategy on getting our "lists" in working order.Each of the 5 working groups should appoint a lead for that group that willbe ultimately responsible for the list activity.Origination and mid-market should work together to prepare 1 combined list.Producer origination and producer mid-market should work together to prepare1 combined list.By next Monday (Feb 12) I would like to have the combined market list andcombined producer list identifying target customers and ENA responsibility.By Monday (Feb 19) I would like to include Credit, EOL Registered, EOLparticipation level, and existing business.  Select someone in the group towork with credit and EOL on these issues.The final list needs to be in the same format and available electronically.Kim Brown will assist in this effort.Over time each group may expand their working list as needed. I appreciate your attention to this matterFrank FYIhttp://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/metropolitan/935345 Today, the House Ways and Means passed it version of the economic package.  The package included a repeal of the corporate AMT retroactive until 2000 and refundable AMT credits.  The stimulus package is expected to be on the House floor later next week.  This is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the Senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate AMT.  Please see the memo below for more info.Also, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a 2-year extension of the Wind Production Tax Credit.Have a nice weekend.

We'll probably have a few more for WIC in the next day or so, but let's get these in to finish out CIG. Well, I am pleased to report that we have our first counterparty that iswilling to sign both the enovate Master and GISB as is.  Jeff - I willovernight the duplicate originals provided by Oneok to your attention.  Wouldyou please initial the signature lines and have your assistant return them tome?  I will get Laura's signature and forward them on to Oneok.Thanks - Gregg Attached is an analysis of the probability of a devaluation in Argentina andthe contractual protections TGS has in the event of a devaluation.Long and short of it is -Argentina's economy is primarily dollarized and it would appear that adevaluation would do considerable short term harm to the economy.Convertibility Law was enacted in 1991.  Large part of the populationremembers the super inflation of 1989 and 1990.To devalue the currency, Argentina would have to amend the Convertibility Law- this requires  approval of the Federal Congress.TGS has numerous layers of protection from a devaluation - in addition to theConvertibility law, it has protection through its license and regulations.Indeed, as you remembered, the tariff is indexed to the exchange rate.A concern is - to the extent the Government takes action as drastic aschanging the Convertibility Law to implement a devaluation, and it is willingto suffer the short term economic and political harm of a devaluation - thenthere is a reasonable chance they would go the extra step and find a waydelink the tariffs of the privatized regulated companies from the dollar.In this case Enron would have protection under the BIT treaty.The impact on Enron's P&L is a function of whether or not we use the Peso asthe functional currency.  If we use the Peso as the functional currency -Enron would have a signficant negative translation adjustment from adevaluation.  If we use the dollar as the functional currency - there wouldbe no impact on our income statement.   I will research this further in orderto ensure we can use the dollar as a our functional currency. Pete Sherri,Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energyeconomics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much tohaveJeff Skilling as a keynote speaker.Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommendthat Jeff speaks at this conference I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronna few times about this conference and  I think that this will bean excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments andagenda for the future.I shall send a separate message to Jeff about this request.

Met with each of Phil Lowry's Direct Reports to gauge theirsupport needs.Completed the ETS Finance & Accounting PRC ! Good Morning!Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month.For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow.So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

As you are aware I forwarded and offer to VNG that  included 4 transactions whereby ENA would sell quantites to Sequent. In addition, I requested that Sequent provide ENA with an offer to serve the Hopwell transaction ( did not tell VNG that it was Hopewell, just described the general service).  Dana Grams told me last week that they were concerned about entering into an agreement to get back their assets, because they felt we may file bancruptcy at which point they would get the assets back for "free".  This is a lame excuse and I generally told him so.  I told him that we were not going to give back the assets and if he wanted them back we needed to get the same or better value to terminate our deal early.  He said they would revisit the arrangement and let me know.  I will keep you posted.Frank Shirley,Please, register me for this.  fyi  Jeff:I have a major problem with Ben Glisan being deleted, especially without a chance to comment.  I believe he is as critical to the organization as all of the "tier two" members (and has had a larger p/l contribution).  If you disagree, I need to know so I can appropriately set his expectations.  I look at this list and I cannot discern the standard for inclusion.  This standard must be clear and will be closely watched by all employees.Andy Please send cookie bouquet from Rod and I. As a result of recent deregulation in states such as Pennsylvania andCalifornia, many new companies are entering the retail energy market.  Today,consumers in several states are able to choose their energy provider in muchthe same way they choose their long-distance phone company.

The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.RegardsJohn Aitor Moso of Iberdrola told me in Madrid yesterday that Iberdrola have"inherited", at least for a few months, 550 MW of import capacity under useit or lose it rules introduced by RTE in '99 or '00. Apparently EdF had keptusing that capacity till early Winter, then kept nominating it for use, butactually did not use it for four months. The reason was excess hydropoweravailability in Spain driving prices down. Once the four month periodexpired, EdF lost the capacity rights and Iberdrola jumped in and booked it.I assume Raphael and Paul are aware of all this.I was also told that RTE is holding a seminar on their France-Spaininterconnection capacity auction proposals in Paris next Monday. Iberdrola,Endesa and Hidrocantabrico (not surprisingly!) seem to be supportive. Are weattending?All these developments will of course be relevant to our answers to the Phase2 questionnaire. When it arrives (tomorrow or Monday?) we may only be given afew days to answer it. Are we prepared?  Bruno and Nailia have some days offin the next week or so let's get to work in advance - providing Ross,Mariano, Paul and Gregor back an intervention. The three previous submissionsto DG COMP to work off are:a) '99  (?) on France/ Spain exports,b) '00 on EdF/ EnBW, andc) '01 on EdP/ Hidrocantabrico.I foresee the most obvious remedies to target being:1) Freeing up LTRs on interconnectors.2) Enhancing VPP auctions.

COP7  Update on ProgressThe mood at the climate change negotiations has picked up considerably since my last email. A compromise has been reached on the Kyoto Protocol compliance regime, which has given delegates hope that Ministers can forge agreement on remaining contentious issues by the end of the week.Under the compliance deal, the Kyoto Protocol will retain its legal status, but decisions on binding consequences will be adopted post-ratification.The rules for the market-based mechanisms and national reporting still have significant unresolved issues, which are being negotiated as I write this report.In the meantime, Ministers arrived last night and have been making their opening statements all day. This will continue for some time.U.S. Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky arrived yesterday evening, but has not yet briefed the U.S. business community. She has scheduled a briefing for tomorrow evening. Traditionally, the U.S. delegation meets with business observers almost every night - the delegation has not met with U.S. business community since last Friday. Many are frustrated by this.Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I report more tomorrow. On a separate note, my thoughts are with every one during this trying time for Enron  there is not much more I can say, but I am reading all the clips and, like you, trying to stay focused and hoping for the best.Again, if you would like to contact me please try via email or call me at +41793453046.All the best,Lisa Please set up a meeting with me, Geof and Steve StockLouise KitchenChief Operating OfficerEnron AmericasTel:  713 853 3488Fax: 713 646 2308 Everyone,I am beginning to receive phone calls and emails from some of the CAbusinesses that Ken sent letters to on Monday.

Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:I.	During regular business hoursA.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.-OR-B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.II.	After hoursFor after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed. As amended as of 5/16/01. Stewart L. SeeligsonEnron Broadband Services713 345-8989 Shirley,I have been summoned for jury duty and plan to be out tomorrow, Wednesday, May 2.Thanks,Stinson Please plan to attend Sally Beck's expanded staff meeting:Date:  Monday, May 8Time:  2:30-3:30 pmLocation: 5C2Speaker: Beth PerlmanTopic:  "Changes in IT"Please note:  Next expanded meeting will be held June 12.Patti Guys, I want to clear up a couple of points:a) if you had received a retention payment in early December with a date that expires Feb 28 - that retention payment will not be at risk in any way if you do not work for NETCO or if you choose to join the effort towards NewCo. That payment was made on behalf of the Enron estate to ensure critical operations  are completed and  key people are retained;b) we are working to provide, as per our discussion this am, a new retention package for estate (and NewCo) employees for the next 90 days that should be forthcoming in the next several weeks;c) you are not in breach of your employement agreement by working towards NewCo versus Netco or the overall estate regardless of which company wrote or sponsored your original contract (ie) ENA , EES, EGM, etc.  These are all Enron assets; andd) I envision that NewCo upon it formation will have its own compensation plan which will provide competitive base salaries, a bonus program consistent or better than Enron's or possibly similar to what is being discussed about Netco, an equity participation plan, employment agreements and a competitive benefits package.By copy to Jeff McMahon, I wanted everyone to know this is consistent with the overall message that I have been receiving.RegardsDelainey My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, issponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in theballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases,our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create thecommon platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for creditaggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financialreporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary hasharnessed information from these databases in a new way to create aneffective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool canhelp measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project,Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and iscurrently under development for delivery later this quarter.We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwidewho will attend the working session next week.

Gregg/Richard, great work on getting Peoples to work with us.  I will look for a copy of their letter requesting assurance that you mentioned.  Please let me know what PGL decides about buying the NSS inventory (13.5 Bcf).Until we hear from them, please do the following:(1) Identify alternative Jan/Feb NSS markets for as much as you can withdraw.  Hopefully PGLC will buy the inventory as planned, but if they do not we need to have alternatives worked out.(2) Detail your plans for liquidating the inventory in the PGL Hub (3.78 Bcf - enovate 1.08 Bcf and EMW 2.7 Bcf).  As part of that, please provide details on the total already committed to (a) physical baseload sales, (b) physical option sales and (c) remaining inventory.  Regardless of the hedges that were in place, we need to get any uncommitted gas out of the ground and sold (preferably pre-pay) as soon as possible.(3) Forward copies of the documents which evidence our rights and obligations under the three storage agreements (EMW/NSS, EMW/ PGL Hub and enovate/PGL Hub).  If no documents exist, please forward any documentation (correspondence, emails, copies of invoices, etc.) which would evidence Enron's to the to the inventory.  Please fax any such documentation to me at 713-646-3460. The attached paper by Dr. Moore of the Reason Institute was sent to me as afinal draft  when in fact it still has edit marks.

Just to make sure, I would recommend wesale the gas to AEP/HPL at the point for the month of June just to make sure the deliveryis made.Let me know what you think.thanks The value should be 0 for R (the value moved from DRN 30685 which should have been changed to zero) and 30685 for D.  All the values were D's consistent with the existing data for DRN 30684 for those days prior to moving the R values over (which should be zeros for those days).Mat Following please find the Daily EnronOnline Executive Summary.EnronOnline Executive Summary for 12/07/00Transaction SummaryExternal Transactions Today	4,125Average Daily External Transactions (30 day Trailing Avg)	4,281Total Life to Date Transactions	508,065EnronOnline Daily % of Entity's Total Transactions for 12/07/00	Trans	PercentEnron North America	3,377	77%Enron Europe Limited	200	35%Global Products	180	32%Enron Metals	368	15%EnronOnline Percentage of Total Corporate Transactions(30 day Trailing Avg)	55%Gross Notional Value of EnronOnline Transactions	TotalToday	3,261,738,861MTD	25,090,717,613LTD	304,261,134,658Average Daily Notional Value (30 Day Trailing Avg)	3,342,091,949Notional Revenue from Physical Flows to Date	19,976,883,663Counterparties, Users, and Products OfferedCounterparties having transacted to date	598New Counterparties transacting for the first time today	2Number of Products Offered Today	1,048Total Number of External Users Logged on Today	3,215Average # of External Users logged on (30 day Trailing Avg)	2,941 Chris,Use this file instead.

Those highlighted in blueshould already be in the database, while green highlighting designates newrecords.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I willleave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.Mat no - just Arnold and Hunter FYI.  I should have copied you on the original e-mail. Thanks, Joannie.  Sorry I didn't see it the first time around!  Sally Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of yourrespective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on adeal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and wecan potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to MarkTaylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare atermination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting tochange an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824),Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746).Call me if you have any questions.Sherix36557 Please ask wes to come over for 9:30 or earlier Shirley,I will take half day off tomorrow morning, on Friday, in addition to today'safternoon.Tanya Please proceed with number one.

With all of the events of yesterday, information for the DPR for the above dates is not yet complete.  At the present time, we are planning to issue a final DPR for the 30th of November as well as a preliminary and then final for the 3rd of December.  However, we do not yet have an estimated time for these to be issued.I will keep you up to date when I have additional information.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.Best regardsShona WilsonDirector, Global Risk OperationsX39123 Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity FuturesModernization Act of 2000.  The purpose of the Act is to eliminateunnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entitiesfalling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act ("CEA") and theprovide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivativestransactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote productinnovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets.Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further productinnovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legalcertainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on anover-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic tradingplatforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.Bilateral TransactionsUnder the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other thanagriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on amulti-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long asthe transactions are entered solely between "eligible contractparticipants"(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capitalthresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentiallycodifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forwardcontracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that hasfrustrated product innovation and growth.Multilateral TransactionsIn addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract ortransaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long asthey the transactions are between "eligible commercial participants", areentered into on a "principle-to-principle basis" and that take place on amulti-party "electronic facility".  This exemption could facilitate expansionof EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legalrequirements will have to be met.Other TransactionsThe Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that areof interest to Enron, including "credit risk measure" commodities and weatherderivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meetcertain legal thresholds.This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collectivesupport of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that havecontributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have amore through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do nothesitate to contact me at (202) 466- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459with any questions. FYI - we had a bomb threat this am.  I'll work with PR to get this fixed.  Pls. forward any questions/concerns to me. Shirley,Expense checks:$6,1101.01$579.69$624.34Vince Sherri, I will be there.RegardsDelainey  James,  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE include Rositza on any e-mail that you send to me.  I have asked you many, many times to please always include Rositza on any distribution to me.  Very often I am tied up in meetings and may not see your notes until after the due dates since they are frequently short.Morris is working with Rod on a change to the TW Operations budget, and I have not received the final amount or approval, yet.  We will need to update Adaytum once Rod has approved the increase.I don't anticipate any other changes by legal entity.Thanks, Elaine Thanks for hosting the breakfast and for emphasizing the importance of thePRC process to the success of Enron.  Prior to joining Enron, I worked at twoother companies in the mid-stream natural gas industry.  As I was listeningto you speak about the way Enron was in the pre-PRC days (the Hay system andthe like), memories of some of my experiences in those organizations camerushing back.  Although I had a number of important reasons for leaving thosecompanies, the key issue in both instances was the failure of theirperformance review processes.I share that information because I have seen both sides, the worst and nowthe best.    As with most things, those who complain or criticize often donot really understand or appreciate how good they have it.  Criticism isoften fostered by a lack of understanding - - people asking "why?" in adestructive way.  The information you shared about the importance of theprogram to Enron,s continued success and the points you made in response tosome of the criticisms of the process were both very important.  I will takeyour message and pass it along, however, I respectfully encourage you to dolikewise to all of Enron.  I know you have previously stressed the importanceof the process at numerous times and through a variety of modes ofcommunication, but this morning you really gave the all-important reasons WHY.I appreciate being selected to be on the committee and look forward toparticipating.  Thanks also your leadership, it's truly inspiring.Sincere regards,Ed McMichael P. V.
