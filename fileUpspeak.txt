Additionally, there were no new releases that exceeded the max tariff rate.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.TW Schedulers - Could you please forward this email and the Sept 2001 TW Capacity Release report to Chris Miller (I wasn't sure which one to select from in the Outlook address list)? Sheila,Please add Reliant to the list of unhappy campers.  Terry Wilson and Tom Acton called to complain last week.  Both are now working with the new report and downloading it to Excel, but expressed reservations about losing the old format.Sorry that I missed John's count on this.Janet Please find attached the code for the HJM simulation model for option pricing and other necessities.The model takes as inputs prices and volatilities and generates a daily spot price grid and respective transition probabilities - a framework for pricing options of multiple kinds.As it is, the model seems quite flexible and detailed. It takes care of fwd-fwd volatilities and uses different factor loadings for each month - this means that the model takes different PCAs as as the curve shrinks in time. Also, the user may define as many factors as the size of # of points in the fwd curve.One interesting aspect is the way I evolved the spot price to provide convergence to the prompt month price as the month approaches its end. Before shocking prices (spot and fwds) I get the expected spot for the next day by linear interpolation with the prompt fwd. By ensuring convergence, however, the model creates a spot price vol that converges to the prompt month vol. The phenomena is illustrated in the spreadsheet example where I call the model for each day of the first month to calculate the respective daily expected prices and vols.As usual, I put the whole project on o:\research\common\project\options\HJM. It is self-contained - no need for other files and the whole source code is there. To see the the spreadsheet you need to install the fwd-fwd vol function and the loading factor function. You will find these things on o:\research\custom. Note that this is not necessary to run the model itself. It just makes the spreadsheet more illustrative and the code more understandable.Regarding the last, I tried as much as possible to make the code clear and lean hoping that you feel confortable with its pieces and usability.These are the files:Please let me know your opinion and the bugs.Thanks.

Jason (et al):We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to "prime the pump" are:1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)2)  What is the frequency of "jobs"?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)These are just some topics to get us startedyou may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forwardPlease reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.Thanks,Chris Rick would like to schedule a 90 minute conference call regarding"California: A midcourse assessment of the campaign".

The last scheduled department meeting for the Government Affairs-The Americasgroup, for the YEAR 2000, will be Friday, December 8, 2000 in Houston, TX atthe Doubletreee Hotel.  I have reserved a block of rooms for everyonechecking in the 7th and departing the 8th.   I also want to inform you thatthe Enron Corp. Holiday Party will be held on Saturday, December 9 here inHouston which will give those of you travelling in the opportunity to attend,if you wish.Questions you might have regarding the party.1.  Are spouses invited? (? for employees outside of Houston)  Yes, but atthe employee's expense (ie:airfare).2. Will Enron pay for the extra 2 nights at the hotel?  Yes, if you candemonstrate that, even with the additional 2 nights stay, plus your airfare,it will still be cheaper than a flight leaving the evening of the 8th.   Alot of times airfare will be much cheaper with a weekend stayover.Example: (a)  Round trip airfare (returning 12/8/00)  = $800.00 (airfare only)Example: (b) Two additional nights at  hotel =     $500.00 (airfare w/aweekend stay)$218.00 (hotel 2/additional nights)Total = $718.003. Will Enron pay for additional meals for the weekend?  No.  Meals will beon your own.If you are interested in staying the weekend, please let me know.

Also, it was discussed on how this affects DDVC and other penalties that are billed from a Gas Logistics perspective.  Frank is needing to respond to MidAmerican on how NNG actualizes daily volume at their untelemetered (chart/index) end user points.  Frank would like to schedule a meeting with Gas Logistics, Marketing (Dave Neubauer), GMS (Gary Anderson, Ellis Stern) to discuss the end user agreements and the procedures that GMS uses when determining actual flow at the end user points.  Frank wants all parties within ETS to be aware of some to the issue involved in this process.Lynn & Raetta,  could you schedule some time to discuss.  I would like to bring you up to speed on the previous conversations and calls that I have had with Marketing, MidAmerican and GMS on this subject.I will be out of the office on Wed and Fri. this week if that helps.

I have been informed that as of this Friday (11/30/2001), my assignment here at Enron comes to an end.  Obviously, Enron's current economic uncertainty predicated the need to alleviate any and all "excess baggage" (read: consultant/contractor costs).I truly have enjoyed my time here in the Gas Fundamentals group.  I have definitely learned a great deal from everyone, and hopefully have helped others to do the same.  I leave my contact information below, in hopes that if there is anything I can do for you in the future, you will not hesitate to get in touch with me (especially to let me know what time to be at Front Porch! ;-).All kidding aside, this has been a great overall experience for me.

Nymex futures prices have fallen a totalof $0.68 over the last five days.

Lynn, I need to take a 1/2 a day vacation on Monday, September 24th to leave at noon and I would come in early that day too and 1/2 a day vacation on Tuesday, September 25th I would be in the office at noon time.  I would like to go to a cousins wedding out of town and I've put it off because of the move but am being harassed by family but if it's not possible that's okay.Thanks,Ava Vince,I thought I would just send you a personal note to say that I hope you are well. Being part Brazilian, I feel responsible to make sure that you enjoy the great country you're visiting. It is a shame that you will be spending time in Sao Paulo and not Rio, which is a far more beautiful city - I know since I grew up in Sao Paulo. I hope that your experiences of the past few days will not put you off paying further visits to this land.When I arrived at work on Monday morning, Shirley asked me if I could call the Brazilian Consulate in Argentina, and she explained the predicament you were facing. I tried and tried to get through but all the numbers at the consulate were continuously busy. Eventually, we agreed that it might be best if handled from the Brazilian side of Enron. I understand from her that you have finally been able to get to Sao Paulo, so I hope that the business you went to discuss has gone successfully.I imagine that by now you may have been introduced to a good Brazilian churrasco, tasted some real coffee, and perhaps sampled some of the many tropical fruits that Brazil boasts of (speaking from a culinary perspective). If you haven't yet been to any of the Brazilian restaurants here in Houston, I would be happy to introduce you to them when you return. I wish I could recommend good places to visit in Sao Paulo, but it is not really a city for tourists. If you had more time, I could suggest some art museums, a visit to the municipal theatre, or some relaxation in one of Sao Paulo's parks; a trip down to the coast would also be worthwhile.Well, I wish you a safe return journey and look forward to seeing you back safe and sound. You were greatly missed yesterday morning at our Bosses Day Breakfast.Regards,Tom Please see the attached REVISED Contracts/PLE On-Call Schedule.The only change is that Esther's pager number (888) 378-6258 has been added.

You have been identified as a person who has traveled to the Enron Washington, DC during this time period.  You can contact Dr. Holland directly at 713-799-2224 or via email at vah@flash.net <mailto:vah@flash.net>.  Dr. Holland will be in the Enron Houston office starting at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, November 2.The CDC has recommended new updated guidelines for facilities receiving mail from the Brentwood facility since October 11.  Individuals in private facilities receiving incoming mail from the Brentwood facility are recommended to receive a 10 day course for prophylaxis with doxycycline.  This should include all permanent employees in the Enron Washington office and possibly other visiting Enron employees to the Washington office who have had possible contact with mail coming from the Brentwood facility.  The final recommendations regarding the completion of the full 60 day prophlyaxis will be based on further information from the CDC.  These are the current recommendations as of October 27 and are subject to change pending recommendations by the CDC.The CDC has recommended doxycycline for use for prophlyaxis.  Presently, there is no indication that the anthrax is resistant to any antibiotics.  Doxycycline is just as effective as Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.   Doxycycline is a tetracycline drug and should not be used in anyone who is allergic to tetracycline.  Women who are pregnant should check with their Ob-Gyn physician prior to taking tetracycline.All ENRON EMPLOYEES are encouraged to take the flu shot this year.  Since it is difficult to distinguish the symptoms of anthrax from the flu, the CDC has recommended that everyone have a flu shot.  All Enron employees from the Washington D.C. office and those who have visited the Washington D.C. office since October 11, should see their personal physician, if they develop any symptoms such as mild fever, muscle aches, malaise, shortness of breath and headaches.  These can be symptoms of the flu.  However, they also can be symptoms of inhalation anthrax.  If any such symptoms should occur, the employees should see their personal physician right away.  The employee should inform the physician where they work and what their exposure could possibly be from mail coming from the Brentwood station.Dr. Venessa Holland There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct""Enron Activity - ICE" Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.Let me know if you have any questions or comments. Matt MotsingerEnronOnline713-853-5221 If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required Enron to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep Enron whole.  Any thoughts?Tom  Steve will be on vacation Monday January 7, returning to the office on Tuesday.Scott Abshire will be in charge during Steve's absence.Scott will be available by email on Blackberry, his office phone is 713-853-1460, and his cell phone number is 713-853-6780.Steve will be available by email on Blackberry.Thank you,Rita HouserETS IT713-853-5110 I would like to request carryover of 7 vacation days from 2001 to 2002.

Thanks,Leslie This is about Enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for trading future of a movie's gross box office receipt. Rich sent to many people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide some feedback.I think the idea (see below) might be applicable to other parts of Enron. We can call it "Dynamic bid-ask price process".In fact, we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is submitted to the system within a specified amount of time. The final (clearing) bid and ask prices are just the last "tentative" price shown to the public before the bidding period ends. (So the customers can see the final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish.)I think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via EnronOnline.com.-Chonawee  Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated this afternoon on the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:Citizens K #20822 Res - flowed alternate deliveries to Socal Needles of 32,145 dth and should be billed incremental fees [I have prepared a spreadsheet to calculate at the max applicable tariff rate for the alternate path]ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to BurlingtonConoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge typeConoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E.

The target was to have data on all India plants collected by Jan. 15th.We all know that getting power out o Maharashtra holds the key to being ableto solve the Dabhol challenge.  With all of your help, this model can becomethe tool that tells us exactly how that can be done, and at what prices.We are a substantial part of the way there on data collection, and have gotdata of some 1500 plants across the country.  The spreadsheet for the same isattached.  This will help you answer any questions that come up in callsabout the various plants.  Please note that we are located in the WesternRegion, or WR in the spreadsheet.  We will be further scrubbing the data andgetting more recent and accurate information, especially on Maharashtra overthe next 2-3 days.The Henwood team will be in India on Sunday, and will compare notes with theteam here.  I am arranging for a presentation on the model and what it willdo.Wade - It would be good if a broad section of the team attend, includingNeil, yourself and Mohan.  I will talk to you about a convenient time for youin this regard.Neil & Mohan - Over the next week (Monday and Tuesday) I will need some timefrom Vivek, Anshuman, Ravi, and a few others, to interact with the Henwoodteam.  I will be abliged if you can make that possible.The first phase of model runs (which will be done by Jan. end) will just giveus some more basic information, but I will need all of your inputs in orderto ask the right questions.  The idea is that as we go along, this model willbe used to answer all types of management questions concerning Dabhol, andpower evacuation out of Maharashtra.This will be critical for the team going forward.Regards,Sandeep. this memo was sent to Miranda.ThanksAva Oneok recap for October Joe    3-0518 Attached are the shipppers who have not paid their December transportation invoices as if 11:30 a.m. 1/15/2002.Market Service reps - Please call your shippers if they are on this list and determine why they did not pay on the due date.

If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer. I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?

The impact of this would be that EGM content would no longer be available within the Commodity Fundamentals website.  I personally do not feel that this is the best decision for the business ENA&EGM, it would limit the current vehicle in which content is delivered.  I also believe that considering the current state of Enron this is not the time to duplicate cost & effort because of ownership concerns.

They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.They are also talking with Mustang at the 26"Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG  this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System  severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.Joe and Sherry See attached file. The monthly accummulated imbalances has been identified by area. Let Ricki know ASAP if you are interested Just FYI.

This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:1 Lead Physical Trader1 Physical Trader1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator1 Supply Middle Marketer/OriginatorI met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.Thanks,Tom Take my name off, too.

Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct "fool-proof" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the "scheduled quantity" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Bob,I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to youabout on the phone.I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transactionbyphone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain thetransactionto you.Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has justreturned to Houston from India after working with the team here.He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would likeyou to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussionpleasesend us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market.Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from theIndian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may need torepeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account for thesemaybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there will be anEnron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and uponconsolidationthere will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that we would liketohave mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through Mauritius, andthenCaymen Islands.Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in theUSthere will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, inIndia, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any incomeshowing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would gettreated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in theUS.I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of theincome is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F andotherconcerns).Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract andgetting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed toIndianCorporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type ofaccounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, andwill brief you on the same.Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an excitingprojectfor us all.Regards,Sandeep.

The savings that Enron receives from using TAP isinsurmountable.  See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated withsome of the airlines.  Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least3-7 days in advance.  Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potentialswitching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price forhotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then thecorporate rate.

I have talked to Chris Germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job.  Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with Chris leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like Chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from Daren as I have him through next Friday.On another matter, I believe Daren has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does Rick Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (Kathy Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from Daren next week.Tom Lynn, I have no problem with Shirley, however, since she has began working from home, I have had limited interaction with her due to our work schedules.  She mostly works with the late person (Jean) and the early person (Jerry).  Therefore, if it is at all possible to choose someone else from the team that I work with more closely, I would appreciate it.

Ginger DernehlAdministrative CoordinatorGlobal Government AffairsPhone# 713-853-7751Fax# 713-646-8160 John,A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely. Following please find the Daily EnronOnline Executive Summary. Should Jim Schwieger be included as he has been in prior PRC meetings.  He knows all the gas traders and middle marketers and has been valuable to this process in the past.Tom Tom,Attached is the new profile matrix with all the new products added inpurple.

Below is a brief description of the group'spurpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone inadvance for what I know will be a successful effort.What this group is about:       Identifying best practices within PublicAffairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources anddocumenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possiblethroughout Public Affairs.How we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.Why we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financialresources because we have an obligation to direct those finite resourcesto their highest and best use.When we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).What's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of howyour group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resourcesare allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (shouldbe distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).Finally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last yearto implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I willprovide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel freeto call me if you have any questions before then.*  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this workinggroup.

Thanks!!Click on this link  >     > Gov Affairs>ProjectsContactsInstructions:  >Copy of E:mail sent on 8/25/99Upon further reflection after the recent staff meeting, I have made thedetermination that any and allengagements of outside resources, e.g., outsidecounsel & consultants, public relations firms, etc must be approvedthrough the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process.  Accordingly, the $2500trigger that had been in place is no longer.  To ensure that the processworks in a more timely manner, I am creating weekly RCR meetings (Harry, Jim& myself) at which all pending RCR's will be acted on.  I will deal withemergency RCR's as they may arise between the weekly meetings.Bottom line, the RCR process is of enormous value to the group as it helps todocument that we are properly focusing the company's resources in the placeswhere it is of most value.  I firmly believe that whatever minorinconveniences this change will entail, they are minor in relationship toensuring the success and credibility of the RCR process. Memo sent on 3/18/99 John:Claudio put together a spreadsheet for cheking the change on a composedjackup index against the change on individual categories of jackups andsemis. He did not weighted the index because we think we will benefit from asimpler index price calculation by taking the straight average.The results show a good R-square between the general index and individualjackup categories - on the range of 0.7 - 0.8. Only one category displayed apoor R-square - about 0.3. For semis of 4tht and 5th generation, however, wenoticed a degradation on the hedge effectiveness - R-squares about 0.2 - 0.3.You may verify each regression by changing the choice cell (AX2 on Analysis).Claudio is also starting to analyze how gas and crude past moving averages,12 month swaps on gas / crude, and rigs utilization explains the daily rates.We will forward the results as soon as we finish.

For the time being, we will use the burn estimates which come from the plant to determine our confirmed volumes on Transwestern and El Paso, as well as daily discussions we have with Duke, PPL, and our gas control.  In my absence, the rest of the Transwestern scheduling team will be trained to do the daily confirmations and work with gas control with regard to daily flows.Thank you for all your cooperation.

It has become even more important than ever before that you notify me when you will not be attending.It is important for me to turn in accurate numbers to the caterer on Tuesday afternoon.  If you know you will be traveling, have a conflicting meeting scheduled or you are going to be on vacation, please notify me that you will not be attending the Thursday staff meeting.  Due to so many of you being on other floors, it is difficult for me to know your schedules.I don't want to have to go back to box lunches, but it may be necessary if I cannot submit accurate numbers to the caterer.  When Vince consented to let us have more hot meals and use different caterers, it was on the condition that we watch the costs.  Please help me keep these expenses in check.Regards,Anita DuPontEnron Research Group713-853-0329EB 1969 FYI,  Frank & Courtney,  this is a correspondence that Raetta has received from Gary Anderson (GMS).

Any question please give me a call.  		j.  floyd I spoke with Eric today regarding the recommendation.  As he will likely inform you in an email, the only current recommendation needed would be solicited by email of phone from AT&T.

Eric may need a general letter later, however, in the future.Martin Attached are the notes from this weekend, Vince/Stinson,I met with Rebecca McDonald, and introduced her to Mr. Sud on Saturday.The meeting went on quite well, and Mr. Sud repeated the point he had made tome regarding NTPC buying the power.  He did not ask for any consulting orother contract, but said that he would try to help.Rebecca seemed happy with the meeting, but I do not know whether she has aplan in mind going forward.I can give you more details of the meeting if anyone is interested.

My apologies,The last few products were doubled up.  Please see the revised list. This piece from Deutsche Bank is good macro overview of electricity supply / demand fundamentals.  A little on the long side - 78 pages, but has some good discussion on NERC (North American Electric Reliability Council Regions), beginning on page 15. I don't know what his experience has been, but Mr. Cartwright appears to be a bit pessimistic on EME credit.  Could he be confusing the EME loans with the Mission Holdings loans? Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnificationobligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the MemberManager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjustedpurchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materiallydifferent from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA werethe actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports theissuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.Regards,Chip SchneiderVP-Commercial Underwriting713-853-17893AC 1418 Lynn,Do you know what time you are going to meet with the TW team tomorrow?Since the Team Leader meeting has been canceled, I would like to plan on being there when you meet with the team.Would you please let me know.Thanks,Beverly As requested by Jeff Shankman, here are the average EOL and NON-EOL dealsbroken out by month and region since EnronOnline launch (11/29/99).

Vince,Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had beenaccomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by theinformation available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed hisinterest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created fromthe format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has alreadymade changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platformfor EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I havelooked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. Ihave also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site,but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any furthersuggestions would be appreciated.I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modificationsmay be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at thewebsites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together apresentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.Tom Enron is hosting a special event on Saturday, March 31st.

I know, Zimin. It was/is an honest mistake, and I am hurting from it. It does seem that things have worked out, and that the issue has been resolved with Larry May and John Griffith. Additionally, I have been in touch with Jeremy Wong to ask that the ERMS coding be updated, and have been in communication with Eric Moon (Gas Structuring) to make sure that the structurers are aware of the changes made. Eric told me that they have always used the OSTRIP function for fixed price options in the manner which is correct by the documentation.Paulo suggested that I find out if there are any power traders who use the function and alert them. I asked Alex but he didn't know of anyone. I also talked to Iris, but she didn't know of anyone either, although she did say that they have priced strips on the power desk before. Would you know of anyone who uses this function on the power desks, so that I might contact them? Thanks.TomPS I trust the conference (and Paris) are treating you well.

Shirley,How does Tuesday look for Vince ?  This is the meeting we had been trying to schedule. I invoiced Aurora Natural Gas on 10/4/01. Needs to be updated on the spreadsheet.Thanks, Hi guys,it was nice to work with each of you for the last couple of weeks. It wasgreat time and I enjoyed every single day here.I am very much impressed with research team in Houston and looking forward tostrengthen our co-operation even further.Have all great time and not a very hot summer.hope to see all you soon.many thanks,Slava Please forward comments concerning the format, level of detail and content etc. Lynn, I have resolved Tony Gee and Matt Martindale questions concerning this weekend storage allocation for the gas day June 23.Matt was concern that Tenaska's Mid-17 contract 106171 was cut by our storage allocation the first time on Intraday 2.  In fact this contract received a small cut on the Non-Grid AM cycle.  Matt changed his nomination in the evening cycle to change some of his supply from Northern Border's Ventura to Mid-17 storage.  This nomination change will now be code as "incremental" on his storage contract 21229 for the remaining cycles.  Tenaska was able to avoid storage allocation cut on their IDD contract 21229 until Intraday 2 due to a "PRR" code for supply cut by Northern Border at Ventura.  Our storage allocation  only cut Tenaska Mid-17 path for gas delivered to their contract 21344 due to storage cuts downstream.  I have advised Matt  to be aware of these problems when changes nomination.Tony Gee thought he was being "bump" or cut in the Intraday 2 cycle on his IT contract 5915 and FDD  contract 102835 on his supply from Northern Border's Ventura.  Prior to Intraday 2 we donot true-up storage allocation cuts until Intraday 2 with Northern Border.  Tony was only checking his nomination with Northern Border on his contract 5915 and seeing all his volume schedule to flow.  Tony failed to check his schedule volumes in Hot-Tap after the evening cycle to see his actual schedule volume was cut due to storage allocation.   Advised Tony to check his schedule volume in Hot-Tap after each cycle.James I wanted to wish each of you a Happy New Year and to also let you know that I will be on vacation through January 7.

People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.Tom Pat:  Out co # is 0413, RC # is 107043.

However, themain modeller for Henwood (David Yumigada) works out of their Californiaoffice.It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs, andexplain the modelling algorithm to the larger group.In aparticular, now that I am going through some of the comments people haveraised on the PSIM model, I think there is value in understanding the wayHenwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts, ramp up costs, and with issues ofcycling plants.I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of thePSIM, and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models.This is a suggestion, and so please let me know if you see value in this.Regards,Sandeep.

I also think that FMAs have their own advantages anddisadvantages.However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBORas benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (forexample, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different fromthat on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, useanything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value productssignificantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR foreverything priced on Capital Markets .We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity,recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities)we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).Let us continue our discussion on this.Slava Benjamin Parsons13/03/2000 20:07 See if you can open this version.

Attached is the Bushton Balance through November 17th, 2001. If you have any questions, please call me @ (713) 853-6600. Negative dollars represent amount to the shipper - Positive amounts represent amounts due TW.Currently all shippers received a contract balance statement.   The imbalance is calculated on this statement as follows:(Scheduled Receipts less Scheduled Deliveries less Fuel)  *  Avg index = imb value.    - - Currently, if TW owes a shipper for an imbalance (scheduled receipts are higher than scheduled deliveries and fuel) uncollected transport and fuel is not deducted from the amount payable to the shipper.There have been few cash outs by TW to shippers in the past.  I can recall one instance when a large payable balance was created and the shipper nominated additional volumes to reduce the balance to a minimal amount.  TW then paid the shipper for the remaining balance.Also,  oba statements which reflect payable balances at receipt points do not deduct unbilled transport from the amount due to the operator.Does our tariff allow us to deduct transport and fuel from paybable imbalances -  Will we have to reimburse shippers/operators for overbilled fuel? Thank you for the offsite.  It was great to spend time with people from other parts of Enron Americas and to hear Greg speak so frankly about the issues and opportunities within the Company.

The shippers were indifferent to the "new" report, when they were shown how to extract the same data. A worksheet is available in T:\COMMON\AR  GT_3Days COM08.xls of commodity invoices billed August 2001 accounting month that have not cleared AR.Please update the Excel worksheet by 5 p.m. on Thursday (10/18) to reflect any payments that have been received but not cleared in SAP or to report the date your shipper will remit payment. If your shipper is not paying or short paying the invoices, include the reason. Provide a copy of  your payment detail or SAP report to me to support unapplied payments.Also, there are 30 outstanding August 2001 DEMAND invoices totaling $84,487 that are outstanding. Please apply any payments immediately or advise me of any disputed issues concerning these invoices. (The affected analysts have been given a report of the invoices to be resolved.)The new cash application process should be used to apply payments. (See T:\Common\Market Services Training\ARNettingProcedures.ppt  to get a copy of the procedures.)Let me know if you have questions or need assistance.

(FYI, the TAP is likely to change at the next board meetingI'll send you a revised version next week.)The next step is an initiative to improve spending controls by linking DASH approved levels to the Accounting and Treasury systems.  Rick Carson will be heading up this project and coordinating with Accounting and Treasury for support.Please distribute this as you see fit within your team.

We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As ofAugust 8th less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge.Enron,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporatematch). ENA,s share of this goal is $346,500.  While these are aggressivegoals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, wecan easily surpass these goals.Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100%participation throughout the organization.  This is especially importantamong our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who hascompleted their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what thelevel.I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is acontributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this yearthan last year.  Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensatedwith generous options and bonus program, I encourage each of you to become amember of the "Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% ofyour annual salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase yourpledge this year, regardless of your level of giving last year.With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need thesupport of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels acrossthe ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decisionregarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from ourExecutives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Yourcontribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in ourcommunity.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously andgetting your pledges in by August 9th.Login to system on Netscape or Explorer    unitedway.enron.com Hi Everyone,The budget meeting will soon be upon us and I want to keep everyone informed as to what will take place.

If you have any suggestions for improvements I would really appreciate your feedback.  Secondly, If you had any comments or suggestions from the customers during the training I'm trying to get them together so I can include them with the feedback given at the other break sessions.  You can send them via e-mailing or come by my desk.Also several of you mentioned given the new hires the training document, I think this is a great idea so I'm attaching a copy.  If after going over the document there are some questions, let me know and I will be glad to meet with them. Thanks,Maggie We have been downgraded by S&P to junk status, our bonds are trading at about $0.20.  The stock is down to $3 and dropping. The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)there are only a few outstanding issues remaining  The pipes in question are:-  National Fuel and GasThis site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to thembasically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust  Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem-  TCOWe have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.  Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.-  CGTThis is a "sister" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.  We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.  I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.  It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).And that's it!!  TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.  So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.Now, my only question is who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!? ;-)As always, any questions, just ask.Thanks,Chris David Kendrick from The University of Texas may be good.Vince J Kaminski04/24/2001 05:11 PM Effective tomorrow please call the below number to call into the daily morning meeting with John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen.1-800-713-8600Password:  476724Please feel free to call me with any questions.Regards, The next scheduled RCR meeting will take place as follows:Date:  Monday, July 16Time:  12:00 PM (CDT)Number: 1-800-283-1805Thanks!gngr713-853-7751 Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.

I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.Thanks,Tom Thanks.  I got Jim's and Eric's right after lunch.  Jim was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  Eric seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.Tom Ladies & Gentlemen:Attached is NNG's Weekend Notes for January 12th & 13th.

Tana CashionDavid Oxley@ECT10/05/2000 10:20 AM > There are increasing requests for IT development resources for databases andwebsites within the group.  There are two issues involved regarding thisactivity:  Enron Networks is now charging for such development, and theproduction of these many and various projects leads to high maintenance needsand projects are often abandoned after short use.If you need a new database, it should be developed in one of the desktopapplications that everyone has - Word, Excel or Access. Suchdocuments/databases can be shared on the O: Common/Public Affairs drive.  Ifyour needs are more complex than these applications will support, or if yourneeds are more global, an effort should be made to fit the data into theProject Tracking database.  Contact Elizabeth Linnell for this globaldatabase.Products/information to be published to the intranet should be placed on theexisting Public Affairs intranet site. Having multiple sites is confusing toour customers and an ineffective use of resources, as well as expensive todevelop and maintain.  Contact Earlene O'Connell regarding additions to thewebsite. It appears that the wrong service was stopped last nighta request to stop/restart the real-time weather service also seems to have resulted in the stopping of the Jaguar harvester  This caused no scrape jobs to run last nightThis morning the service has been restarted, and data has been recovered  This should be examined closely, as there is the possibility that information is the same for cycles 1 and 2 of certain pipes (this may or may not be an issueif it is, please advise us on what should be done)Thanks,Chris Anyone interested in Slainte (509 Main St) after work  ? 4pm (for the lucky ones) onwards !!!http://www.slainteirishpub.com/frames/fr.html Mark,We have begun the process of having members in the group look at the work done and review the usefulness with regard to energy.

Based on what you said and assuming this document is ok, count me in.  Sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard.  I don't believe I have any issues with financial terms that you said (again I want to see what it looks in writing).  I still don't fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50% of the commercial people is all that we end up, this shop will still be better than any other on the street.

The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.Tom The next scheduled RCR meeting will take place as follows:Date:		Monday, October 8Time:		1:00 PM (CDT)Number:	1-877-660-6591 (domestic)      (please note the new numberI'm using the new WorldCom conferencing service)Leader passcode (Rick only - 833951)Participant Passcode (558191)Thanks and call if you have any questions.Ginger DernehlAdministrative CoordinatorGlobal Government AffairsPhone# 713-853-7751Fax# 713-646-8160 REMINDERHere is the information for today's conference call.Wednesday, July 111:00 to 2:00 p.m. Central Timedial-in number:  800-486-2460participant code:  675-923host code (Lawner):  263-406Leslie, if you need assistance during the call, please press "# 0".

Let me thank you for the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the period after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful company before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, and you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was singing on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, probably because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be "OKLAHOMA" so I joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 and wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother always used to tell me as a child, "you better keep a thought in mind, that someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their examples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:If I can help somebody  as I pass along,If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,Then my living shall not be in vain.And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.God Bless You Both,Glenn B. SloanSr. Clerk, ContractorEast Power Generation DevelopmentEB 3150 D713.345.2786 According to Bloomberg, the Mission Energy Holdings deal has been cut from $1.2 billion to $700 million with price talk as high as 14%.

The initial step will be to come up with the key risk indicators.  An initial list will be worked out by Mark and Andrew for further discussions. There is also an AA model that will be discussed to come up with what should be done at Enron.Currently we will be going with a qualitative approach based on the key indicators developed.  Over time we would go with the standardized approach.Mark was very interested in discussing the model he has developed for quantifying operational risk.  A meeting to discuss that with the Research group will be held next week, and I will get an appropriate date for that.

To protect Enron's proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.ExamplesCase 1Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and Katy)Total Index Position           300,000/d longVols. targeted for storage   200,000/dEnron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  Enron sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.Case 2Core term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)Thirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua Dulce, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d Katy)Total Index Position            200,000 longVols. targeted for storage    200,000/dEnron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.

Our success in achieving these objectiveswill define the group,s success in the New Year.Two of our top three objectives involve providing support to the RiskManagement group in EES.  Number 3 and Number 2 (one of the number 2,s) are,respectively,Ensure that PG&E,s generation-related stranded cost is &rolled off8 nolater than September 30, 2000 and generally protect and inform EES curvesUnderstand rules/tariffs/outcomes better than anyone else and convert toinformation valuable to business unitsAs a general matter, it is imperative that we continue to assure ourselvesthat our everyday efforts are focused on achieving the objectives that are socritical to our success.  The way the group provides support to EES RiskManagement, and in turn achieves the objectives noted above, is one areawhere there is potential to improve performance with a refocusing of efforts.Toward this end, I am asking that these individuals take on theresponsibility, for their respective regional group, of being a point ofcontact for EES Risk Management:Mona Petrochko, Western Region  Kate Wagner, South Central/Southeast RegionBecky Merola, Great Lakes/Midwest Region Frank Rishe, Mid Atlantic/NewYork/New England RegionMona, Becky, Kate and Frank will work with individuals on the EES pricingdesk to improve the flow of information necessary for timely, accurateutility rate curves and help EES develop strategies to improve the economicsof existing outsource deals.  I expect this activity will take a significantportion of their time.  They will coordinate their efforts with HarryKingerski and Pat Keene who will continue to provide a centralized support toEES Risk Management from Houston.I recognize that many of you are called on from time to time to provide othertypes of support to EES, for sales calls, licensing requirements,environmental issues, legal support, and the like.  This change in no wayaffects these other activities and you should continue to pursue thoseefforts.As a final note, I invite all of you to identify and bring to me ways we canimprove our chances of success in meeting any of our Year 2000 objectives.  Iam not interested in change just for its own sake but will certainly considerdoing things differently if our likelihood of success can be improved.Best to you for the New Year!

This is an update on the O:Research folder.  We have had a case of sevral files getting deleted from the folder last evening.The IT folks are currently restoring these from the backup they had from yesterday.  They will be replacing the files that were deleted but will not be overwriting those files that are still there.This incident puts an air of urgency on the O:Research directory access project that I had written to the group about.  Bhala has been coming around to members in your groups over the last week to get a list of folders that you are responsible for, and the desired access rights to these folders.  This is information that only you can provide, and without this we cannot start limiting the access of people already having access to the folders.  (Incidently, I am currently rejecting all write access requests from outside the group till I have approval from one of you).Please do treat this as an urgent undertaking in light of the incident yesterday.  We have already created a separate O:Research/External folder where we need to house all those folder/files where access is broader than the Research group.  Please help us expedite this process.  We would like to have this in place before the weekend.Regards,Sandeep. There will be a trader's roundtable meeting today at 4:00PM in EB3321.  Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

The NG Price book granted $500 of Middle Market Central Originations that wasnot recognized by the Intra-Central book on the NGP&L.Thanks,Robin Since the initial update on the transition of the metals business into Enron,a tremendous amount of progress has been made by the London-based integrationteam to achieve our goal of a seamless integration of the two businesses bythe end of the year.  We can now report that we are well on our way toreaching this target and as a result of this work we will be welcoming thearrival of the London-based metals team into Enron House over the weekend of15th September.  Accordingly, I feel it is important to provide you with anoverview of one critical aspect of the transition process ) namely, there-branding and re-positioning of the metals business as a core commercialunit within Enron.We announced in July that the metals business would be re-branded globally asEnron Metals.  This trading name will serve as the umbrella under which thebusiness will operate, with the exception of Henry Bath & Son Limited, themetals warehousing division, which will retain its current brand image and berecognised as an Enron company.  Since this announcement about our brandingstrategy, Fiona Grant in Public Relations and Sue Kelly, our CompanySecretary, have started working on the re-branding programme.  A briefoverview of the steps taken to date and a summary of what should be expectedover the coming months is provided in the attached file.As was stressed in the initial announcement about the change of name, a keypart of the integration of these operations into Enron will be the conclusionof a successful re-branding programme.  To this end, given the size of EnronMetals, the re-branding initiative will be phased in over the next few monthsand should be completed by the end of 2000.  Accordingly, we would ask thatall staff bear with us through this process, as the new corporate identity isrolled-out worldwide.Any questions relating to branding issues should be directed to Fiona Grant,Public Relations and Communications.

(EOT) registered 2million of its subordinated units for its holder Koch Petroleum Group L.P.for conversion into 900,000 common units in the company and an option to buyanother 1.1 million common units.According to a filing Friday with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the registration is part of a recapitalization agreement that thecompany, Koch and Enron Corp. (ENE) signed Sept. 6, which still must beapproved by the company's unitholders.Under the registration, Koch may sell all 2 million subordinatedunits prior to approval of the proposed amendment to the company'spartnership agreement or if the amendment isn't approved.As reported, Enron and Koch Petroleum have agreed to convert all 9million of their outstanding EOTT Energy subordinated units and $9.2 millionof additional partnership interests into about 4.3 million common units.The company said the shift in capital structure will allow thecompany to increase cash distributions to $1.95 a unit from $1.90.Houston-based EOTT Energy is an energy company that gathers andmarkets crude oil and refined products in North America.-Joanne McPike, Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert; 202-628-7669;joanne.mcpike@dowjones.com INDIA: Panel suggests Indian govt pay in Enron row-paper.10/01/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - An Indian panel has suggested the federal government be willing to spend almost 57 billion rupees ($1.19 billion) to help resurrect the Enron Corp Dabhol power project, which stopped producing electricity more than three months ago, a business daily said on Monday.The panel was constituted in early 2001 to review all aspects of the controversial power project, set up at a cost of $2.9 billion on the west coast of India.The Business Standard daily said the panel's report had suggested Dabhol's various stakeholders all be willing to absorb the costs that would have to be incurred to revive the 2,184 MW gas-based project.Dabhol Power Company is 65 percent owned by Enron Corp . GE and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a local state-owned power utility, owns the remaining 15 percent.The western state of Maharashtra is a guarantor to the Dabhol project and the federal government is its counter-guarantor.U.S.-based Enron has said it wants to exit the project after a bitter dispute with the local utility, which had initially contracted to purchase all the power from Dabhol Power Company's plant.It subsequently defaulted on payments, saying it didn't need that much power, which it claimed was too expensive in any case. Enron claimed the utility was reneging on its contractual obligations.Dabhol finally took the utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London, warning India faces liabilities worth $5 billion.But Enron has simultaneously said it is willing to settle out of court if it can recover its costs.While there have been many suggestions, the panel's report is among the few to provide a detailed solution, including the liability each party would have to shoulder.A SOLUTIONThe panel was set up by the Maharashtra government. Its main brief was to suggest ways of reworking the power purchase agreement so as to reduce Dabhol's tariff. After the dispute worsened, the panel was also asked to suggest revival measures.The panel proposed that if all the stakeholders were willing to absorb the specified losses, the tariff on Dabhol's power could be reduced to between 2.25 and 2.4 rupees per kilowatt-hour from 3.65 to 3.91 rupees at 90 percent capacity utilisation, the newspaper reported.According to the panel's report, the federal government's liability of 56.63 billion rupees included an infusion of 25 billion in cash, waiving customs duties on the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and cutting import duties on capital goods, the report said.It said the panel has also suggested Enron, GE and Bechtel together absorb a loss of 28.35 billion rupees on their investment in the project.

This meeting was arranged at Vince's request,since Vince had been approached by Mr. Sud's son who is a student at Rice(where Vince teaches a course).  The younger Mr. Sud had wanted someone atEnron to meet with his father who was visiting Houston, and is currently anadvisor (post retirement from the government) to the Prime Minister's office.This was my first meeting, and I have no background check on the person.However, the meeting was interesting, and Mr. Sud conveyed to me inconfidence that the Indian govt. is very interested in solving the Dabholissue.  He also conveyed that a decision is being made in the direction ofNTPC buying all the power from Dabhol, but that this was still under wraps.I have no way of judging the genuineness of this person, but he claimed tohave been Secretary in the Ministry of Defence for some 16 years, which is avery important post in India.  The information he was conveying seemed soimportant that Vince and I decided to update you on the same by phone thismorning.Mr. Sud is leaving Houston on Monday so, as discussed, I will see if he canmeet with you on Saturday morning.Regards,Sandeep. Please find the attached workbook (see 'Breakdown by Month' tab), which has been updated for the August index calculations on PG&E releases.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.Thanks.Elizabethx3-6928 Vince,Please find below some text for Eric's letter.  I hope it is helpful for your development of the letter.  If you have questions or would like some other information, please let me know.  Also, on the question of Enron letterhead, I suppose the desired form of submission is via the web site.  Unless you have electronic letterhead, the issue may be moot.MartinEric Cope worked as a summer associate in the Research Group during the summer of 2001.  During this time, Eric worked on a variety of projects requiring a diverse set of skills.  In all cases, he quickly grasped the scope and context of the problems at hand.  While some direction was given in each case, Eric was often charged with developing the approach details independently, and he executed the tasks very effectively.One major project for the summer was to develop a web-browser-based trading simulation platform (TSP).  The TSP would create user accounts, require user logons, post simulated market information, post simulated commidity prices, accept and execute buy and sell transactions for users, and track user account information such as positions, order history, and buying power.  The TSP would allow for the use of human users as well as software agent.  Simulated commidity prices could be histroical prices, ficticious calculated prices, or bid/offer prices based on some update algorithms.  The primary goal was to create a framework to test different udpate algorithms and trading strategies.Eric immediately arranged for the appropriate reference materials to develop the database and associated software infrastructure.  In short order, a simple site was up for users to create accounts and begin "trading" commodities.  The project ended before extensive algorithm evaluation could begin, however, the TSP goes a long way to making such evaluations possible.Other projects included the development of forecast models for motion picture box office revenues, advertising media placement prices, and long-distance voice telephony prices.  In many of the cases, data were scarce, as were definitive instructions.  Eric analyzed the problem to develop a focused approach, always in consultation and discussion with others, but never with "hand-holding" or intense oversight.  His co-workers and immediate supervisor quickly developed confidence in Eric's ability to take general direction and achieve productive results.  Such confidence and ability is crucial in an environment with limited structure, such as we had. Timesheets are due Wednesday, October 31st please try to turn in timesheets before deadline. Vince,Please find attached a small note I had prepared at Wade's request.  The noteis to be used for a private meeting of the ex-Chairman of MSEB with thegovernor of Maharashtra.

Iexplained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from theHenwood study.DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  Theremaybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issuesthat I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get toHouston.I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for sucha long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him toHouston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize thatbefore I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things herehave deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.

Same dial number (as below) will apply for this call.Ginger DernehlAdministrative CoordinatorGlobal Government AffairsPhone# 713-853-7751Fax# 713-646-8160 Please see attached. I would like to add the following items to the agenda.  I believe that coming to a resolution on these issues will increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the TW team.-Team members hours of coverage, and job responsibilities-Rotating team coverage responsibility in an emergency, and possible solutions to minimize unexpected coverage issues 	(weekdays, weekends, and late nights)Thank You,Christine Vince,Please see below some of the ideas being bounced, FYI.  Please keep thisconfidential.The unused capacity in Maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis,ON BEHALF OF MSEB to any customers outside MSEB's current purview.  I wouldlike us to look at the whole issue as one of MSEB's poor credit, and hence (as Jeff pointed out on the call), one where we need to identify all deeppockets in and out of Maharashtra.Secondly, there is (as Shubh and I had pointed out) the ability to evacuateabout 700-1000 MW to customers other than MSEB.  The challege is - at whatprice, and in coordination with which agencies.  As always, in India yourgreatest challenge will be in dealing with govt. agencies.Another point to consider is that in-all we have about 5-7 customersidentified.  Will all the customers we have earmarked bite ???  This is thereason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10-15day power on the screens of the different SEBs we can connect up with.  Thisalso substantially gets around the credit quality issue, as this would be anarrangement akin to cash-and-carry.  I see a lot of hope for such astrategy.  I do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of powerto either NTPC or PTC.  I would agree however, that we not put all our eggsin one basket, and hence you could designate a team to look into the NTPCsale issue inparallel.In order to set up the trading sytems, however, we need to start by the endof Q1 2001, and just start doing small deals where we break even, simply totest the waters and introduce liquidity into the market.Hand-in-hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy, as I havebeen pushing for.  For this to happen, we need to get the Special ImportLicence reinstated.  If that is not possible, we need to lobby with thehighest authorities within govt. and RBi to allow for hedging, irrespectiveof whether we have an SIL.  The discussions being held with IOC are thereforevery important in this regard, and I am going to get Anshuman and Mukeshinvolved with the same.Finally, I do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ENE managementfor $75 Million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatoryframework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than thegeneration side of the equation.  I would refrain from stating this in anysenior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate thecost-benefit of this.  I have some ideas on that side which I need to developfurther.Regards,Sandeep. Attached is a final draft of the LV Cogen Turbine Swap DASH.  The only variable at present is the payment schedule.

I believe Sandy King meant 12/24 rather than the 23rd.  However, I will be watching for the payment! Vince/Stinson:The following is an update on LJM deal:1) I participated on a conference call with AA (Jitendra and others) and ourAccounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in whichwe discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end forthe puts we own.2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of thedeal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for putsvalue that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. Thatline of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. Frommy understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any creditreserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factorMC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach isactually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobodymentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process ofunwinding our position.These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.Paulo Issler SK - I printed this out & made copies for all Enron attendees.

Please let me the prices and approximate delivery date.  Also, let me  know if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita Wolak makes some good points.  In ERCOT, Enron is in support of nodal pricing.  I would not go so far as to say we are pushing for PJM's implementation, however, but for a market with nodal prices (and unilateral bids - aka unbalanced schedules, congestion reflect by price differentials, etc).  I was unaware PJM had such great power to alter bids.  This is something we don't want, and something for which I am not aware we have advocated.  Perhaps in Enron's promotion of locational prices, it has been retold as PJM-style locational prices.  Given that PJM is the most commonly cited example of locational prices, it does not surprise me to have the sloppiness in discussions that could lead to the rumors.Martin Below, please find the agenda for the "California Crisis Meeting" tomorrow,Friday, February 16.gngr713-853-7751 Attached is the report I mentioned, in printed form it shows each discount for each path for each contract.

I think everything comes down to liquidity. If they have enough volume, then it will attract even more bidders because the bidders do not have to think too much about the "fair" price because they will always get the lowest successful price anyway. If there is small volume, then it will become harder for the bidders to decide on optimal bidding strategy. Personally I think this system will work because there are many speculators out there who want to play this kind of games.:-)-Chonawee Please see attached.Overall, it was a good weekend.

Please feel free to give me a call, if you have any questions. I am pleased to announce an organisational change within the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group that will become effective immediately.  Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to me and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood, Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer.  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe. .

Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua Dulce, Thompsonville, Oasis Katy, Lonestar Katy, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as Katy Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.Thanks,Tom Lynn, should I cancel Tuesday's team leader mtg. or would you like for me to reschedule for later that day?

The DASH indicates that this request is made in the name of "Enron Americas".Is this something that you have discussed with Brett?  In your view, would this be an Enron Americas matter or an EGS matter?   Who presently owns P/L responsibility for the turbines?  At present, EGS is now listed as the "Controlling Party" on the Turbine Position Report.In any case, I'm fairly certain that a full DASH would not be needed herean IDASH would be sufficient and I can work with Brett on that.Regards, The information contained in the Weekly Public Report can be communicated to audiences outside the company and should be used to ensure that we present a consistent message to the public.

Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe. Please find attached a technical corner article on FTR-like instruments.  Edit as you see fit and comments are appreciated.Thanks,Martin Hey Guys,I probably will need one more spot.  We have been talking about moving Cora into a little different position so that she can handle the Peoples and Chicago office activity.  This means that I will need another scheduler to replace her.  Hunter/Laura do you want Cora with the traders or with the schedulers?  I have told Rain already and have put the spot with the schedulers.  Let me know if you need something different.Lisa John,As we have discussed before, it appears that combining Texas gas and power origination activities is not going to work.  The final nail in the coffin is the fact that in the new building we continue to be on two different floors.  As a result, I would like your thoughts about how to manage the origination activities in Texas.  In my mind there are several possible solutions:1.  Have Barry Tycholiz manage both the West and Texas origination2.  Combine EES Texas retail with wholesale under Mark Courtney (EES has been chasing wholesale gas business in Texas)3.  Have Brian Redmond manage Texas origination (Delainey suggested it; I don't know what you have planned for him but he has contacts with the TRC and 	     customers)Also, I am continuing to interview for one trader and for one middle marketer with the assistance of Todd Piekert in HR.  He has been identifying third rotation associates for me.  One of the candidates that I have been talking to is Charles Weldon who was approved into the trading track program yesterday.  I am going to talk to him again soon, I would like to be able to have him assigned to my desk either as a trader or originator depending where his skills best fit.

I was hired through Enron Associate pool, and started off by marketingpower on the East Coast with Jim Fallon.  Currently I am working in the IndiaRegion, looking into different ways to develop merchant type activities inIndia, anticipating the start of trading activities some time in the future.One of my challenges is to make the team in India aware of the type ofsophisticated operations and processes that we have in place for tradingactivities, as well as the range of products we have to offer.I have been in conversation with Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman on theGlobal Products side, and are planning a session to acquaint the team inIndia with activities in that group.  Similarly, on the power side, we havebeen interacting with John Sherriff's team in London.I feel that it will be very beneficial for some of the team members to getacquainted with the processes on the power trading side in Houston, and toget an idea of the RAC process, the Research side, the Back-offices, as wellas the trading operations here.  Similarly, the team there could present toyou the state of the market in India, and give you an idea of the type ofopportunities there.  I am therefore eliciting your support to put together asession in Houston where they can be acquainted with these functions, as wellas the people responsible for them in the US.  There are three people in thegroup who would benefit from this exposure.  One of them is from theAssociate pool, while the other two are people hired locally in India.I have already spoken with our COO, Wade Cline in this regard, and seek yoursupport in putting together an agenda for such a session.  Please let me knowwho I should contact within your groups to discuss this further.Regards,Sandeep. MikeAttached is the summary of the Carlsbad/Crawford/WT-1 oba.   The balance as of 11/30/2001 is $1,497,337.92 due Transwestern.This balance will probably grow by an additional $50,000 due TW in 12/2001.  Please let me know if you desire additional detail.  Hopefully we already reconcile. I will call Sharon Tischer on Wednesday January 2nd to discuss the other balances that exist between TW and DEFSSW - and also the possibility of netting the Hobbs and Artesia payable balances against the Crawford and Waha receivable balances. Attached is the updated WIP Report for the week of 09/17/01. Regards,Angie CollinsEnron North America Corp.office: 713-853-3347fax:  713-646-3059 John,My suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: Austin, San Antonio or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. Pete) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.Tom Vince,I simply wanted to jot you this note because I find that I am sometimes able to address things better in writing than in a conversation.I want to convey my thanks to you for putting up with me through this period.  I guess I was a bit shell shocked after seeing the project I had worked on, and the team I had built from scratch just going down in a matter of days, not to mention the changes on the personal side.  Through this period you offered me the type of support that perhaps no one else would have, and I want to say that I really appreciate it.Over this period I got so entangled in my own problems and worries that I forgot that leadership is all about caring for others and not yourself.  My house is now in order, and I am back to my old self.  I want to offer you my full support at this time, and am at your service on whatever issue it is that you wish me to take up.  The company is facing trying times, and I would like to help in whatever way I can.Please do put as much pressure on me as you would like.  I promise that I will push myself to the limit.  I am ready for the commitment to learn new skills, and have already been doing this, though it has been a slow process.  I will require yours and others guidance from time to time, but will be ready for anything you suggest.Regards,Sandeep.PS:I have written Paula a note (after our conversation yesterday), and will follow up with her.I am going to send out a mail today to celebrate my daughter's first birthday, and would like you to keep the 11th of November free!

The differences in the markets between East and West are, inTim's opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticatedas the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits forwhich load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loopflows are also not considered a major issue at present.In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extensionto an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also donelittle in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.Martin Irma,I respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.

Regards,Chip SchneiderEB2852x3-1789  There will not be a trader's roundtable meeting today.Thank you,Jennifer Vince,I was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to Jeff Shankmanabout, in the Dabhol LNG context.  It occurred to me that one way to collecton regas charges, and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through therailways.Some time back, I had looked into the possiblility of transporting LNG bytrain.  Apparently, technology exists wherein LNG can be put into cryogeniccontainers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loadedfrom trucks to train bogies.  I believe this maybe a way to earn some monieswith LNG by developing just such a market in India for Commercial customers.It is pertinent to note that the Konkan Rail line is just about 1 hr. 45minutes from the Dabhol plant.  Trucks from Dabhol could carry LNG to therail line at Guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast ofIndia.  If we target end-consumers directly, we could easily sell at retailtype prices, and build in a large margin, even if the volumes disposed arerelatively smaller.  (The alternative fuel for most of these establishmentsis diesel or naphtha which is highly priced, and mostly trucked alongroads,increasing costs).  The end aim is to keep income targets in India, sothat the Analysts do not have a field day with the stock.Hence keeping activity up in India, and showing that solutions exist, willkeep stock price buoyed.  We could explore this idea if it appeals!Regards,Sandeep.

We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put andbuying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place.Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group,and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the groupA whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in closecoordination with the team on the groundThese are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel pricedependent, this is an area that requires close attention.Regards,Sandeep.

Goingforward, I agree with you that we should start the assigment early ratherthan late.However, I would not necessarily like to wait till even Feb 5.  The bids forLNG must go out by the 15th of Feb, and we need to do a lot of fuel basedanalysis before then.  Hence, if it is possible for Anshuman ot be availablebefore then, I would greatly appreciate it.

We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturdayevening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time tobe able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took alook and the following cycles did not get scraped:05/19/2001Kern, Cycles 2 & 4Transco Cycle 205/20/2001KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2Kern, Cycle 3Northwest, Cycle 6I have reset all of the jobsunfortunately, I suspect there is data lossfor the above cycles. One of our "old friends", the 1line Williams site, isdefinately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This sitestill appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the nextcouple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get datafrom as well).As I write this, "capture" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failingdue to "Internal Server Errors".Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilizesoon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactlywhat it was supposed to do when these problems occurit retried until thejob attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.Chris Eric Gonzalez would like to schedule a mtg. with you to discuss the Nigeria & Bahamas presentation.

Also, a call toOverthrust might be in order, to see if they expect any more down time.Thanks,Chris FYI. update on movie trading business.I change my mind. At first I though that we should focus on customers whowant to diversify their unique risks. But now I feel that, at this moment,the "make-sense" people are not easy to find in reality. (Even myself who ownEnron stock, not Dynergy.) There are more risk takers than risk diversifiedpeople. So I think speculators might be our customers in this movie business.-chonawee  I will be out of the office from Wednesday January 16, 2002 until Thursday January 24, 2002.In my absence, Cara Vaughan (713)345-2871, has accepted the responsibility to maintain my customer accounts.If any concerns arise, please contact me at:Home : 281-356-5895Cell    : 713-304-5590ThanksRobert Please find attached the document briefly outlining the department'sactivities in preparation for the staff meeting.Should you wish to raise anything in the meeting this afternoon, please printa copy & bring it with you.RegardsAmber Message from Rick:The Campaign Leadership Call, which takes place daily at 4:30pm CST, is"Mandatory".

I will be back (Monday) January 21st  from 6:30am to 10:00pm   Jerry Jim,Please find attached some slides that show the results of the Henwood rungiving dispatch for the Dabhol plant within Maharashtra.  I have also sentthe presentation we made to you to Wade.  He is to get back on when would bean appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me.Vince, Stinson and I have placed ourselves on Rebecca's calender for Friday,and we will make the complete pitch to her.  It would be great if you toocould be present at the meeting.  If it is possible, please do let me know.On the attached slides, please note that:The slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff, MSEB liability forthe entire capacity payment is not considered.The Henwood model was with no power flowing out of MaharashtraWhen variable O&M costs, fixed O&M cost plus fuel costs increased beyond 5cents/kWh (equal to MSEB's average realization), load went unmetIn 2002 the slide shows the monthly dispatch from Dabhol in equivalent MWterms, and also the load shedding in MaharashtraWe cross-checked the Henwood run load shedding data against actual hourlyload shedding data from 1999-2000 that we had from MSEBMy estimate is that for December and January the load shedding maybe morethan what the Henwood model shows, but overall the run passes the laugh testThe graph also shows the monthly bill (based on 7.21 cents/kWh) that MSEBwould have to pay for the DPC dispatch.The next slide shows our estimate of MSEB's payment capability (range from$38-46 MM/month)The Henwood run shows an average bill for 2002 to be $41 MM/month; though insome months (Jan) it goes as high as $69 MM.  Hence, overall, MSEB can payfor the dispatches as shown in the Henwood run provided, they are not payingfor the capacity payment for the whole 2184 MW plant.In conclusion, therefore, MSEB has the need for between 1200 to 410 MW on aseasonal basis.  This means that the power remaining to be sold to otherstates is the difference between that and 2184 MW.However, since the demand within Maharashtra varies seasonally, it may meanthat we need to market seasonal products to other states, not long termblocks.These are our conclusions.  We may continue to work some more on the fuel andhedging side.  If you have any more questions for me, please let me know,else for now there will not be any new Henwood runs.Regards,Sandeep.
